<h2 class="p4">PREFACE</h2>

<p class="pch">It is an acknowledged fact that we perceive errors in the work of
others more readily than in our own.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Leonardo da Vinci</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this Beginner’s Psychology I have tried to write,
as nearly as might be, the kind of book that I should
have found useful when I was beginning my own study
of psychology. That was nearly thirty years ago;
and I read Bain, and the Mills, and Spencer, and
Rabier, and as much of Wundt as a struggling acquaintance
with German would allow. Curiously
enough, it was a paragraph in James Mill, most unpsychological
of psychologists, that set me on the introspective
track,&mdash;though many years had to pass
before I properly understood what had put him off it.
A book like this would have saved me a great deal of
labour and vexation of spirit. Nowadays, of course,
there are many introductions to psychology, and the
beginner has a whole library of text-books to choose
from. Still, they are of varying merit; and, what is
perhaps more important, their temperamental appeal is
diverse.</p>

<p>I do not find it easy to relate this new book to the
older Primer,&mdash;which will not be further revised.
There is change all through; every paragraph has
been rewritten. The greatest change is, however, a
shift of attitude; I now lay less stress than I did
upon knowledge and more upon point of view. The
beginner in any science is oppressed and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
disheartened by the amount he has to learn; so many
men have written, and so many are writing; the books
say such different things, and the magazine articles are
so upsetting! Enviable is the senior who can reply,
when some scientific question is on the carpet,&mdash;There
are three main views, A’s and B’s and C’s, and you
will find them here and there and otherwhere! But as
time goes by this erstwhile beginner comes to see that
knowledge is, after all, a matter of time itself. If he
keeps on working, knowledge is added unto him; and
not only knowledge, but also what is just as valuable
as knowledge, the power of expert assimilation; so
that presently, when some special point is in debate,
he is not ashamed of the plea of ignorance. He has
learned that one man cannot compass the full range
of a science, and he is assured that so-many hours
of expert attention will make him master of the new
matter. He comes in this way not, surely, to underestimate
knowledge, but to be less anxious about it;
and as that preoccupation goes, the point of view seems
to be more and more important. Why is it that beginners
in science are so often disjointed in their thinking,
so often superficial, unable to correlate what they
know, logically all at sea? There is no doubt that they
are, whether they study physics or chemistry, biology
or psychology. I think the main reason is that they
have never got the scientific point of view; they are
taught Physics or Biology, but not Science. Hence I
have, in this book, written an inordinately long introduction,
and have kept continually harping on the
difference between fact and meaning. I try to make
the reader see clearly what I take Science to be. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
does not matter whether he agrees with me; that is a
detail; I shall be fully satisfied if he learns to be clear
and definite in his objections, realizes his own point of
view, and sticks to it in working out later his own
psychological system. Muddlement is the enemy; and
there is a good deal of muddled thinking even in
modern books.</p>

<p>Not that I offer this little essay as a model of clear
thought! The ideas of current psychology and the
words in which they find expression are still, in very
large measure, an affair of tradition and compromise;
and even if a writer has fought through to clarity,&mdash;past
experience forbids me to hope that: but even if
one had,&mdash;a book meant for beginners may not be too
consistently radical; some touch must be maintained
with the past, and some too with the multifarious
trends of the present. There is something turbid in
the very atmosphere of an elementary psychology (is
the air much clearer elsewhere?), and it is difficult to
see things in perspective. So the critic who will soon
be saying that the ideal text-book of psychology has
yet to be written will be heartily in the right, even if
he is not particularly helpful. The present work has
its due share of the mistakes and minor contradictions
that are inevitable to a first writing; at many points it
falls short of my intention,&mdash;<i>l’œuvre qu’on porte en soi
paraît toujours plus belle que celle qu’on a faite</i>; and I
daresay that the intention itself is not within measureable
distance of the ideal. It is, nevertheless, the best
I can do at the time; and it is also, I repeat, the kind
of book that I should have liked to have when I began
psychologising.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>Psychological text-books usually contain a chapter on
the physiology of the central nervous system. The
reader will find no such chapter here; for I hold, and
have always held, that the student should get his elementary
knowledge of neurology, not at second hand
from the psychologist, but at first hand from the physiologist.
I have added to every chapter a list of Questions,
looking partly to increase of knowledge, but
especially to a test of the reader’s understanding of
what he has just read. I have also added a list of
References for further reading. It depends upon the
maturity and general mental habit of the student
whether these references&mdash;made as they are, in many
cases, to authors who do not agree either with one
another or with the text of the book&mdash;should be
followed up at once, or only after the text itself
has been digested. The decision must be left to the
instructor. My own opinion is that beginners are best
given one thing at a time, and that the knowledge-questions
and the references should therefore, in the
ordinary run of teaching, be postponed until some
‘feeling’ for psychology, some steadiness of psychological
attitude, has become apparent.</p>

<p>I have avoided the term ‘consciousness.’ Experimental
psychology made a serious effort to give it a
scientific meaning; but the attempt has failed; the
word is too slippery, and so is better discarded. The
term ‘introspection’ is, I have no doubt, travelling
the same road; and I could easily have avoided it,
too; but the time is, perhaps, not quite ripe. I have
said nothing of the ‘thought-element’, which seems to
me to be a psychological pretender, supported only by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
the logicising tendencies of the day; and if I am wrong
no great harm has been done, since a description of
this alleged elementary process, by positive characters,
is not yet forthcoming. My references are confined to
works available in the English language; I think it unlikely
that the students for whom this book is intended
will have attained to any considerable knowledge of
French or German. Lastly,&mdash;I believe that this is
my last major omission,&mdash;I have referred only incidentally
to the ‘application’ of psychology; for science
is not technology, though history goes to show that any
the least fact of science may, some day or other, find
its sphere of practical usefulness.</p>

<p>Two of my illustrations are borrowed: the swallow-figure
on p. 138 from Professor Ebbinghaus, and the cut
on p. 282 from Dr. A. A. Grünbaum.</p>

<p>I am sorry to confess that a few of the quotations
which head the chapters are mosaics, pieced together
from different paragraphs of the original. Even great
writers are, at times, more diffuse than one could wish;
or perhaps it would be fairer to say that they did not
write with a view to chapter-headings. I hope, in any
case, that no injustice has been done.</p>

<p class="p2">It is a very pleasant duty to acknowledge the assistance
that I have received from my Cornell colleagues,
Prof. H. P. Weld and Drs. W. S. Foster and E. G.
Boring, and from Dr. L. D. Boring of Wells College.
I am indebted to all for many points of valid criticism,
and I wish to express to all my sincere thanks for
much self-sacrificing labour.</p>

<p>I have retained the late Professor Huxley’s name in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
the forefront of this new primer, partly as an act of
homage to the master in Science,&mdash;the brilliant investigator,
the fearless critic, the lucid expositor; and
partly, also, as a personal tribute to the man it was my
earlier privilege to know.</p>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Psychology: What it Is and What it Does</span></p>

<p class="psh">It is well for a man, when he seeks a clear and unbiassed opinion
upon some certain matter, to forget many things, and to begin to look
at it as if he knew nothing at all before.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Li Hung Chang</span></p>


<p>§ 1. <b>Common Sense and Science.</b>&mdash;We live in a
world of values. We have material standards of comfort,
and moral standards of conduct; and we eat and
drink, and dress, and house our families, and educate
our children, and carry on our business in life, with
these standards more or less definitely before us. We
approve good manners; we avoid extravagance and
display; we aim at efficiency; we try to be honest; we
should like to be cultivated. Everywhere and always
our ordinary living implies this reference to values, to
better and worse, desirable and undesirable, vulgar
and refined. And that is the same thing as saying that
our ordinary living is not scientific. It is not either
unscientific, in the regular meaning of that word; it
has nothing to do with science; it is non-scientific or
extra-scientific. For <b>science deals, not with values,
but with facts</b>. There is no good or bad, sick or well,
useful or useless, in science. When the results of science
are taken over into everyday life, they are transformed
into values; the telegraph becomes a business necessity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the telephone a household convenience, the motor-car
a means of recreation; the physician works to cure,
the educator to fit for citizenship, the social reformer
to correct abuses. Science itself, however, works simply
to ascertain the truth, to discover the fact. Mr. H. G.
Wells complains in a recent novel that no sick soul could
find help or relief in a modern text-book of psychology.
Of course not! Psychology is the science of mind, not
the source of mental comfort or improvement. A sick
soul would not go, for that matter, to a text-book of
theology; it would go to some proved and trusted
friend, or to some wise and tender book written by one
who had himself suffered. So a sick body would betake
itself, not to the physiological laboratory, but to a
physician’s consulting room or to a hospital.</p>

<p>We live, again, in a world whose centre is ourself.
This does not necessarily mean that we are all selfish;
a life may be very unselfish. But whether we are selfish
or unselfish, we live in a universe which revolves
about the Me. Our self spreads and expands, to embrace
our clothes and house and books, our family and
relations, our professional competence and connection,
our political and religious beliefs; we find ourselves
in all these things, and they become a part of us. A
famine in India is a real event and takes its place in the
world only if we are made uncomfortable when we read
of it, or are stirred to send in a contribution, or suspect
mismanagement somewhere and think we could have
done better. And this, once more, is the same thing as
saying that our ordinary living is not scientific. For
<b>science, which deals with facts, is on that account impersonal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and disinterested</b>. Men of science honour Darwin,
because they are human beings and live, like everyone
else, in a world of values; but these same men of
science are ready at any moment to test and criticise
Darwin’s work with the utmost rigour; while any parts
of the work that are solidly established pass without
name into the structure of the science to which they
belong. A text-book of chemistry is about as impersonal
as anything can be, despite the fact that every
observation it describes and every law it lays down was
once somebody’s personal observation or discovery,
and so formed part of some self-centred universe. That
personal interest is irrelevant to science. It is as
irrelevant to psychology as to chemistry. The psychologist
has a great deal to do with his own mind;
but that is because his own mind is the most easily
accessible part of his subject-matter; it is not in the
least because the mind happens to be his own. He
does not care as psychologist&mdash;though he may care
very much as human being&mdash;whether his mind is
superior and talented and broad and cultivated or is
the reverse of all these things; for in the first place
these adjectives are all adjectives of value, and he is in
search of facts; and secondly they are words of personal
or individual appraisement, and he is not concerned
to praise or blame himself. Nor is he concerned
to trace the motives or judge the character of other
men. There is a common belief that the psychologist
is an uncanny person to meet, because he is always
studying human nature and is able to read thoughts.
This belief belongs to the non-scientific world; those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
hold it fear that the psychologist will detect in them some
pettiness or meanness of human nature, or will lay his
finger on some unfounded enthusiasm or some unreasoned
detraction that they wish to conceal. As well
might they think that the physicist whom they ask to
dinner will be occupied with the surface-tension of his
soup or the insulating properties of his mashed potato.</p>

<p>If we trace the history of human thought, we find
that <i>the scientific attitude, as we have here described it,
has emerged very slowly from that mixed medley of superstition
and knowledge and belief and practical interest
for which we have no better name than</i> <b>common sense</b>.
How common sense has been constituted, and how science
has gradually worked its way to an independent position,&mdash;these
are interesting questions; but it is plain
that we cannot enter upon them in a primer of one
special science. Some references for further reading
will be given at the end of the chapter. Meanwhile,
the important thing is to understand clearly the aims
and limitations of science. Science aims at truth; it
deals with facts, with the nature of things given, not
with values or meanings or uses; and it deals with these
materials impersonally and disinterestedly. The student
of science who fails to grasp the scientific point of view
will fail also to get the perspective of a scientific text-book;
he will not see the wood for the trees; and he
will be disappointed with what science has to offer him;
he will want to know the use of all this knowledge, while
science has no regard for use. <b>The laws of psychology
may be put to very many uses</b>, in business, in education,
in legal procedure, in medicine, in the ministrations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
religion; but such uses are, from the psychologist’s point
of view, by-products of his science; just as the nautical
almanac is a by-product of astronomy, or the safety-match
a by-product of chemistry, or the stamping-out
of malaria a by-product of biology. These practical
results may be immensely important for everyday life;
but science, in its impersonal and disinterested search
for facts, makes no difference between one fact and
another.</p>


<p class="p2"><a name="c5" id="c5">§ 2</a>. <b>The Subject-matter of Psychology.</b>&mdash;Psychology
is the science of mind. What, then, is mind? Everybody
knows that, you will say, just as everybody knows
what is matter. Everybody knows, yes, in terms of
common sense; but we have seen that common sense
is not science. Besides, common sense is not articulate;
it cannot readily express itself; and it is a little afraid
of plain statements. Close this book, now, and write
down what <i>you</i> take mind to be; give yourself plenty
of time; when you have finished, go over what you have
written, and ask yourself if you really know what all
the words and phrases mean, if you can define them or
stand an examination on them; the exercise will be
worth while.</p>

<p>Open the book again! The exercise was worth while;
but it was not quite fair. For the fact is that these
great comprehensive words that we all use and all
understand cannot be rigorously defined; they are too
old; they have lived through too many changes; they
have gathered about them too many conflicting associations.
They pass muster in our everyday discourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
only because we take them for granted and do not
scrutinise them too closely. The expert alone can say
what common sense means by mind; and even the
expert must speak in general terms, qualifying and with
reservations.</p>

<p>It seems, however, that the prime factor in <b>the common-sense
notion of mind</b> is the idea of activity. We
ascribe to mind the same sort of voluntary and purposeful
activity that we ascribe to our fellow-men; and
we distinguish this activity from the blind necessity of
cause and effect. We find ourselves, and those about us,
deliberating, intending, resolving, planning, recalling,
doubting; and we say that these and similar activities
are activities of mind. We also find ourselves, and those
about us, breathing, secreting, moving; but here we
draw distinctions. Breathing, we say, is a physical
affair, though we may hold the breath by an act of will.
Secretion results from some physical or chemical cause;
only if we cry for sorrow or sweat for fear is mind influencing
body. Walking and blinking may be physical
only; but if we turn our steps by intention into a certain
path, or blink on purpose to clear our sight, the
physical movements become subject to the action of
mind.</p>

<p>So long as we stick to examples, all this seems straightforward;
only it is not easy to decide whether mind is
activity, or whether these various activities are activities
of mind. On the whole, common sense leans to the
latter view: the activities are manifestations of mind.
Mind itself is then something immaterial, lying behind
the manifestations. What sort of thing? Apparently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
another human being, <b>an inner man that dwells within
the outer man</b>, an insubstantial mannikin living inside
the head. Does that sound absurd? But it did not
seem absurd just now to read that we ascribe to mind
the same sort of voluntary and purposeful activity that
we ascribe to our fellow-men; and how could we do that
unless mind were something like a human being? This
inner man appears, in fact, to be the mind of common
sense; the inner man thinks, reflects, remembers, desires;
he is influenced by the outer man, becoming
gloomy and morose when his host cannot digest; and
he influences the outer man, who sheds tears when his
inmate is grieved. A curious view, when we write it
out and think of it in cold logic; but a view that we
should understand if we traced the growth of common
sense from its first beginnings; and a view of highly
respectable antiquity. Very ancient superstitions are
connected with the man who is seen in the eye; the
Egyptian <i>ka</i> or spirit-double is a smaller copy of the
outer man; Greek vase-paintings show the human soul
as a tiny human being; primitive thought has from
time immemorial explained, and the modern savage
still explains, the life and motion of man, or his repose
in sleep and death, by the presence or absence of the
little creature normally at work within him.</p>

<p>Yet however natural a view like this may be, science
can make nothing of it. For one thing, it merely pushes
the problem a step further back. The inner man acts
on the outer man and is acted on by him; but who or
what gives the inner man, in his turn, the power to
influence and to be influenced? We must suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
an endless nest of mannikins. That and other such
arguments apart, however, the view is non-scientific because
it offers an interpretation and not a description
of mind. <i>The mind with which psychology deals must
be a mind that is describable in terms of observed fact</i>;
otherwise it cannot form the subject-matter of a science.
So we must start afresh, and ask what mind is, when
mind is looked at <b>from the scientific point of view</b>.</p>

<p>You will better understand the answer to this question
when you have worked through the book. The answer
will then have been given in the concrete and particular;
now it can be given only in the abstract and general.
Remember that it is given, nevertheless, in terms of
work done and results obtained; it is not an answer
that the psychologist makes up beforehand, but one that
he himself has been led to in the course of his attempt
to work scientifically upon mind. In brief it is this.</p>

<p>We find that the field of science has been surveyed
from two different standpoints. Men of science have
set out, on the one hand, to describe the world as it
would be with man left out. The result is what we call
physical science. The world of physics is colourless,
toneless, neither cold nor warm; its spaces are always
of the same extent, its times are always of the same
duration, its mass is invariable; it would be just what
it is now if mankind were swept from the face of the
earth. For what is light in the text-books of physics?&mdash;a
train of electromagnetic waves; and sound is a
vibratory motion of air or water; and heat is a dance
of molecules; and all these things are independent of
man. But men of science have tried, on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
hand, to describe <b>the world as it is in man’s experience</b>,
as it appears with man left in; and the result of this
endeavour is psychology. The world of psychology
contains looks and tones and feels; it is the world of
dark and light, of noise and silence, of rough and smooth;
its space is sometimes large and sometimes small, as
everyone knows who in adult life has gone back to his
childhood’s home; its time is sometimes short and sometimes
long; it has no invariables. It contains also the
thoughts, emotions, memories, imaginations, volitions
that you naturally ascribe to mind; it contains, that is,
so much of these things as belongs to the sphere of observable
fact. It is obviously very different from the world
of physics, though both worlds alike have been opened up
to us by science, by the impersonal and disinterested
search for facts.</p>

<p>So we have a world of matter and a world of mind.
The physicist, however, describes and measures the
various phases of energy, without assuming any material
substance in the background, any matter of which
this energy is the manifestation. Matter, if the word
is to be used at all, is simply the inclusive name for all
the forms of energy. And the psychologist, in the same
way, describes and measures&mdash;so far as he is able to
measure&mdash;the phenomena of his world, without assuming
any active or perduring mind in the background;
for him, mind is simply the <b>inclusive name of all these
phenomena</b>. That is the first rough answer to our
question. Much more must be said, if the answer is to
be precise; but even as it is we have travelled a long
way from the little man living inside the head!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c10" id="c10">§ 3</a>. <b>Mind and Body.</b>&mdash;The first thing to get clear
about is the nature of the <i>man left in</i> the world, the man
whose presence is necessary for psychology and unnecessary
for physics. Since we are talking science, this man
will be man as science views him, and not the man of
common sense; he will be, that is, the organism known
to biology as <i>homo sapiens</i>, and not the self-centred
person whom we meet in the everyday world of values.
But the human organism owes its organic character, the
organisation of its parts into a single whole, to its <i>nervous
system</i>. All over the body and all through the
body are dotted sense-organs, which take up physical
and chemical impressions from their surroundings;
these impressions are transmitted along nerve-fibres
to the brain; in the brain they are grouped, arranged,
supplemented, arrested, modified in all sorts of ways;
and finally, it may be after radical transformation in the
brain, they issue along other nerve-fibres to the muscles
and glands. The nervous system thus receives, elaborates,
and emits. Moreover, there is strong evidence
to show that <b>the world which psychology explores</b>
depends for its existence upon the functioning of the
nervous system; or, if we prefer a stricter formula, that
this world <b>is correlated with the functioning of the
nervous system</b>. The <i>man left in</i> thus reduces to a nervous
system; and that is the truth of the statement,
often met with in popular scientific writing, that the
brain is the organ of mind. There is no organ of mind;
that phrase is an echo of the old-world search after the
place of residence of the mannikin-mind, which was
assigned variously to heart, liver, eye, brain, blood, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
was supposed somehow to perfuse the whole body.
The scientific fact is that, whenever we come upon
mental phenomena, then we also find a functional nervous
system; we know nothing of the former apart
from the latter; the two orders are thus correlated.</p>

<p>The fact of this correlation has been established by
two principal lines of evidence. In the first place, we
find all through the animal kingdom that <i>size of brain
and complexity of nervous system are matched by range
and complexity of mental phenomena</i>. The brain of man
is, by absolute measurement, an organ of great size; it
is heavier than that of any other animal with the exception
of a few of the very largest (such as the elephant);
and in these cases the superior weight is due, not to superior
development of the elaborating part of the brain,
but to the bulk of the receiving and emitting portions,
which are of a size to correspond with the bulk of the
body. The brain of man is also relatively, as compared
with the weight of the whole body, heavier than the
brain of any other animal with the exception of a few
of the most highly developed small mammals (such as
certain monkeys); and in these cases again the superiority
depends on the bulk of the receiving and emitting
portions of the brain, which reflect the keen sensitivity
and muscular agility of the animal. We know, on the
other side, that the mental life of man is richer than
that of any other creature. Secondly, we find that <i>disturbance
of certain parts of the brain indicates a certain
form of mental disturbance</i>; and, conversely, that particular
forms of mental disturbance indicate disturbance
of particular parts of the brain. One may become blind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
from injury to the brain as well as from such defect of
the eye as prevents optical impressions from reaching
the brain.</p>

<p>These are the two lines of evidence. How, though,
you may now ask, do we know anything about the distribution
of mental phenomena in the animal kingdom?
<b>How do we know that the lower animals live in mental
worlds?</b> and still more how can we say anything as to
the nature of the phenomena that make up those worlds?</p>

<p>Consider first <i>the case of your fellow-men</i>. You do
not doubt that they have experiences like your own; you
take them for granted, accept them instinctively as
your kin, and are able&mdash;the better as you know them
better&mdash;to put yourself in their place. If, however,
you had to argue the matter with a sceptic, you would
point to the facts of our common life. Man’s family
life, social life, civic life, national life, is based on the assumption
that human experience is alike for everyone,
and would be impossible if the assumption were falsified
by the facts. All these forms of life, for instance,
presuppose language and laws; and language and laws
necessarily imply a community of experience. You
would point, also, to likeness of physical organisation,
likeness of sense-organs and nervous system; and you
would point, lastly, to conduct or behaviour. When you
feel in a certain way, you act in a certain way; your
behaviour expresses your feeling; and when, under the
same circumstances, a creature of like organisation regularly
acts in the same way, you have a right to infer
that this creature has a like feeling.</p>

<p>Now consider <i>the higher animals</i>. They possess a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
physical organisation closely resembling that of man.
They also behave in ways that appear to express feeling.
If you were familiar only with their structure,
with their sense-organs and nervous system, you would
be ready to endow them with mind; if you knew them
only by their behaviour, you would reach the same conclusion;
since you may know both, and may therefore
correlate physical structure with conduct, you are able
to form a fairly accurate idea of their mental world.
But <i>as you go down the scale of life, difficulties arise</i>.
The nervous system changes its type, and presently
disappears; and behaviour becomes equivocal, so that
students of behaviour dispute whether it is still expressive
or is purely mechanical. The controversy is even
carried over from the animals to the plants; there are
psychologists who seriously attribute a mental life to
plants. Be that as it may, the important point for
us is that, as the nervous system simplifies, so does all
available evidence indicate that the world of mind simplifies
with it; and if mind extends further down the
line of life than the nervous system, we have merely
to change the wording of our general statement; we
must expand it, and say that, throughout the realm of
life, size and complexity of the nervous system, or of
that vital mechanism which precedes the nervous system
and anticipates its functions, are matched by range and
complexity of mental phenomena.</p>

<p>The <i>nature of these phenomena</i> cannot be set forth with
any assurance. It is difficult enough to psychologise
the life of the Australian Arunta, who is our fellow-man,
or of the dog who has been our companion for half-a-dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
years. What shall we say of the spider, or the
amœba, or of sundew and eelgrass? All that we can
do is to follow back the history of the sense-organs, from
complex to simple, comparing as we go; and to observe
how the organism behaves under given circumstances,
comparing this behaviour with that of other organisms
higher and lower in the scale, and bringing our comparison
back again and again to its final term in our own
experience. We lose a great deal when we lose the nervous
system; but life, after all, is a continuous development;
and the disappearance of this special structure,
though it may mean that our statements become vaguer
and less definite, need not make our general quest hopeless.
Honesty of purpose, and a passion for knowledge,
and sound scientific training will carry a man further,
even in this dark continent, than the casual enquirer
would deem possible.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c14" id="c14">§ 4</a>. <b>The Problem of Psychology.</b>&mdash;The subject-matter
of psychology, as we saw on p. 9, is the whole
world as it shows itself to a scientific scrutiny with man
left in. Or, to put the same thing in another way, psychology
gives a scientific description of the whole range
of human experience correlated with the function of
the human nervous system. We have just learned,
however, that there is a psychology of the lower animals,
possibly even of plants; and we must therefore say
that we were speaking in § 2 of the subject-matter of
human psychology. This is the psychology that will
occupy us in the present book. Let us now see what our
actual task is. <b>What have we to do, in order to get a
scientific description of mind?</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>We must do what everybody does who begins to
describe; we must take things piecemeal. When you
are away at the seaside, and are describing your room
in a letter home, you tell of exposure and windows and
carpets and furniture and pictures; you break up the
room into parts, and list them one by one; but you
do not list at haphazard; you bring your items into such
connection as will make it easy for your readers to reconstruct
the room. The man of science does the same
sort of thing; he analyses, and all the while he is analysing
he has his eyes open for relations, for putting his
elements together again as they belong. The chemist
analyses water into oxygen and hydrogen, and acetic
acid into carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen; and you see
at once that this <b>analysis</b> is the first step toward a
scientific description; for it reduces the compounds to
their elementary components, and it shows that the
two compounds have certain elements in common.
But the chemist, almost in the same breath, is putting
together again. The ordinary formulas for water and
acetic acid, H<sub>2</sub>O and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, indicate that; for they
show the number of atoms of the various elements that
are held in the compound. Chemistry also has graphic
formulas, of a kind that look complicated to the outsider
but that are really more instructive than the others,&mdash;formulas
which show in what manner, under what
laws, the atoms are bound together. Any good encyclopædia
will give you samples.</p>

<p>The psychologist, now, stands before a like problem.
The mental world, no less than the material, comes to
us in the gross; mental phenomena are complex, often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
highly complex; we must reduce them to their elements,
we must keep analysing till we can analyse no further,
if we are to describe them in a scientific way. And here
too <b>synthesis</b> goes hand in hand with analysis. Psychology,
to be sure, does not write graphic formulas;
but psychology has to show how its elements go together,
to discover the laws of their connection; we
shall find that tones and colours go together in very different
ways. All the while that we are tearing a bit
of our world apart, and finding its elements, we are trying
to put those elements back again in their places
and to reconstruct the original experience.</p>

<p>Synthesis, unfortunately, is often very difficult;
and you must notice that a <i>failure to reconstruct does not
necessarily mean that the preceding analysis was wrong</i>.
A chemist may analyse a given substance into a certain
number of elements, each one represented by a certain
number of atoms; yet if he puts these elements together
again, in the right proportions, he may&mdash;perhaps because
he is now working at a different temperature&mdash;come
out with another substance of different properties.
His analysis was not therefore wrong; but his
attempt at synthesis is a failure because he has not
taken account of all the relevant circumstances. It may
happen similarly in psychology that we do not know all
the relevant circumstances; or it may happen that we
know them but cannot control them; in such cases
we cannot reconstruct. The only thing to do is then to
make analysis its own test; we analyse again and again;
and if the result is always the same, we are satisfied to
let it stand. Children who do not know how to prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
an example in arithmetic follow the same plan; if they
get the same answer several times over, and if their
schoolmate gets that answer too, they are satisfied;
and when the work has been honestly done, the agreement
is pretty good evidence that they are right.</p>

<p>Notice one other point: that if you sit down to describe,
there is simply no escape from analysis. <i>To begin
a description is to be analysing.</i> Well-meaning people
sometimes shake their heads at scientific psychology;
all this dissecting work, they say, misses the real issue;
it kills mind; it destroys the living, breathing reality
of experience, and offers in its place a catalogue of dead
facts. The mannikin again! Of course, if mind is a
little man inside you, you must kill him to dissect him,&mdash;though
he nevertheless crops up again, alive and well,
after the autopsy. The mannikin, as we have seen,
cannot face cold logic. No, the task of science is to
describe; if you are to describe you must analyse; and
the results are every bit as real as the unanalysed experience.
Dead facts? But a fact is the most live thing
possible; it will survive any number of theories, and
will still give birth to more.</p>

<p>Lastly, since mental phenomena are <b>correlated with
the function of the nervous system</b>, the psychologist’s
task is not complete until he has acquainted himself
with the physiology of that system, and has worked out
the correlation as accurately as is possible. Here,
again, is something that you will better understand when
you have read further in the book. For the present
we will notice two points. First, the psychologist can
gain access to a large part of his world only by way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the organs of sense; and it is therefore important that
he know the structure and functions of these organs
and their relation to the brain. Secondly, a train of
mental phenomena may be guided and directed by
events, occurring within the nervous system, which
themselves have no counterpart in the world of mind;
for, while all mental phenomena are correlated with
processes in the nervous system, not all processes in
the nervous system have mental phenomena to correspond
with them. Unless, then, the psychologist knows
the nature of these guiding events, he will be like the
chemist who failed to take account of temperature;
he will lack knowledge of relevant circumstances.
Special books upon the nervous system have been written,
giving in outline what the student of psychology needs
to know; some of them are referred to at the end of the
chapter; but it is an advantage to have taken a practical
course in the physiology of the nervous system, and
to be able to think in terms of neural processes. If you
have had no such opportunity you can still learn a good
deal from diagrams and verbal accounts; and you may
find comfort in the assurance that there have been eminent
psychologists who knew very little about the brain.</p>

<p>In fine, then, the problem of human psychology is
threefold: to analyse mental phenomena into their
elements, to discover the laws of mental connection,
and to work out in detail and under all its phases the
correlation of mind with nervous system.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c18" id="c18">§ 5</a>. <b>The Method of Psychology.</b>&mdash;Having learned
what we have to do, let us ask what method we are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
follow in doing it. So far as the nervous system is concerned,
it is evident that the psychologist must take
his cue from the physiologist; indeed, this part of his
problem makes him, for the time being, a physiologist,
only that his real interest remains centred in mind.
But how is it when he is attacking the other parts of
the problem? Is there a special psychological method,
a peculiar way of working, that he must adopt in his
study of mental phenomena? The answer is No: his
<b>method is that of science in general</b>.</p>

<p>This method may be summed up in a single word as
<b>observation</b>. All scientific description, all description
that reflects a disinterested and impersonal search for
fact, is got by way of observation. And observation
implies three things: a certain attitude towards phenomena,
a vivid experience of the particular phenomenon
which is the object of observation, and an adequate report
of this experience in words. The relation of these
three things will be clear if we write a formula for observation,
thus:</p>

<p class="pc1">psychological (vivid experience → full report).</p>

<p class="pn1">The adjective outside the bracket shows that we take
up a psychological attitude to the world; in other words,
that the world which we are exploring is (to use our catch-phrase
again) the world with <i>man left in</i>. The adjective
applies to the whole contents of the bracket; the experience
which we are to have is mental experience, and our
account of it is to be couched in psychological language.
We are, then, ready for the experience; it comes, and
we give it our best attention; we then express it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
words; and we try to express it fully and adequately,
in the words that it itself points to and requires. When
the account has been written down, and so made available
for other students, we have completed a psychological
observation. When a number of such observations
have been taken, we have the materials for a scientific
description.</p>

<p><i>Observation is by no means easy</i>; “there is not one
person in a hundred,” said Huxley, “who can describe
the commonest occurrence with even an approach to
accuracy.” The reasons are partly of a technical
nature; the use of scientific method is a bit of skilled
labour, and skilled labour presupposes training; at
first we are likely to be careless and clumsy; we do not
see the need of scrupulous care, just because we do not
know exactly what it is that we are doing. The great
reason lies, however, in that difference between science
and common sense to which we have already adverted;
common sense interprets, and science describes. Malobservation
is due, in the great majority of cases, to the
ingrained tendency of the onlooker to interpret, to explain,
what he observes. How many educated men and
women to-day believe that the full moon dissipates the
clouds? and how many more believe that changes of the
moon coincide in some way with changes of the weather?</p>

<p>These remarks apply very definitely to psychology.
<i>The psychological observer needs technical training, first
and foremost, because mental phenomena never stand still
to be observed</i>; mind is always in course, always going
on; he must learn either to take rapid notes as the
experience is passing, while he still remains alert to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
new phases as they come, or he must register the experience
phase by phase in memory, and reproduce it in
words after it has passed. Nothing could well be more
misleading, as a name for mental phenomena, than the
familiar phrase ‘states of consciousness’; for a state
is something relatively stable and permanent. Mental
experiences are moving, proceeding, ongoing experiences;
we might make up one of Lewis Carroll’s portmanteau-words,
and say that their essence is a processence. We
shall henceforth speak of them as <b>mental processes</b>;
only remember that they are not processes of something
or in something, like the processes of decomposition and
fermentation; they are experiences whose very nature
is a proceeding, a course in time.</p>

<p>Secondly, <i>the psychological observer is badly handicapped
by common sense</i>, which has long drawn a distinction
between the method of psychology and the method
of physics. Psychology is supposed to look within,
to turn its eyes inward; physics is supposed to look
out upon the objective world, and to keep its eyes in
their normal position. The method of psychology is then
an introspection or self-contemplation, a looking-in;
and the method of the physical sciences is an inspection,
a looking-at. The self which is thus introspected
is, of course, judged and valued and approved and
blamed; we know the ear-marks of common sense. So
we find that the hero of yesterday’s novel “was not
given to introspection. His external interests in life
were too engrossing for him to think deeply or continuously
about himself. Such a habit of mind he used
vehemently to deprecate as morbid, egotistical. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
now”&mdash;now the fateful girl is on the scene; the hero
begins to think about himself; and flatters himself,
poor man, that he is turning psychologist.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, neither a keen appreciation of his
own virtue nor a rooted distrust of his own powers makes
a man into a psychologist. Science turns its back upon
the world of values. If, then, we are to keep the word
<i>introspection</i> for the method of psychology, we must
write the equations:</p>

<table id="t01" summary="t01">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdl1">introspection</td>
  <td class="tdc1">=</td>
  <td class="tdl1">psychological (vivid experience → full report)</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td class="tdl1">inspection</td>
  <td class="tdc1">=</td>
  <td class="tdl1">physical (vivid experience → full report)</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn1">where the adjectives outside the brackets mean simply
what we have already stated them to mean. When
once the initial attitude has been taken, and the world
to be explored has thus been determined, the methods
are the same. The beginner in psychology will however
find, again and again, that his common-sense self stands
in the way of disinterested observation; and as the
word introspection contains a reference to this self, he
may prefer to drop it altogether.</p>

<p>So much for observation in general! When we come
to particulars, we find that science, wherever possible,
has recourse to <b>experiment</b>. This does not mean that
science renounces observation. For an experiment, if
we push our definition back to fundamentals, is simply
<i>an observation that may be repeated, that may be isolated,
and that may be varied</i>. See the advantages! Repetition
gives us plenty of time for observation; we need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
not mind overlooking something now, since we shall
have the opportunity of picking it up later; and we
can go on, observing and observing, until our description
of the phenomenon is as complete as it can be made.
Isolation makes our task easier; disturbing influences
are ruled out; our attention is not distracted; we can
give ourselves wholly to the matter in hand. Variation&mdash;the
substituting of one factor for another in successive
observations, or the emphasising in one observation
of a factor that was obscure in another&mdash;helps
us to clear up doubtful points; to distinguish what is
universal from what is only accidental in the phenomenon
we are observing; and to bring this phenomenon into
relation with kindred phenomena. <i>Repetition saves
hurry and worry; isolation prevents distraction; variation
keeps us from jumping at conclusions.</i> These are the
advantages of experiment; and all experiments, in
physics, in chemistry, in biology, everywhere, fall under
this definition.</p>

<p>Psychology needs the experimental method for both
the reasons noted above: because the observed phenomena
are elusive and slippery processes, and because
the observer is warped and biassed by common sense.
We may therefore show by an example <i>how psychological
experiment is possible</i>. Suppose that we wish to
find out how a printed word is perceived,&mdash;whether
we read it letter by letter, or take in its form as a whole,
or take in certain letters clearly and the general form
vaguely. We first prepare our material. We print
upon cards, or photograph upon lantern slides, a large
number of words. We employ different printing types;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
different groups of letters; different lengths of words;
single words and groups of words; words properly
spelled, and words altered by mutilation or omission of
particular letters at different parts of the word. Every
one of these classes of stimuli, as the words may be technically
called, is represented by a number of cards or
slides. The stimuli are mixed in haphazard order, and
are thrown upon the screen by a reflectoscope or projection
lantern in an otherwise dark room; a pneumatic
shutter before the lantern makes it possible to show them
for a brief time, say, a fifth of a second. All this apparatus
is put in the charge of an experimenter. When
the material is ready, and the whole arrangement works
properly, an observer is called in. He works for a limited
time, at the same hour every day, and only after a
certain time has been allowed for his eyes to accustom
themselves to the dark. The stimuli are presented at
regular intervals. The observer reports what he perceives
at every exposure of a stimulus, and the experimenter
writes down what he says.</p>

<p>It is plain, now, that these observations may be
repeated. For one thing, there is a group of like cards
in every class; and for another thing, the observer
himself (since he works every day at the same time and
under the same circumstances) is a fairly constant quantity.
Besides, the observations may also be made by
other observers, in other laboratories, under precisely
the same circumstances; they may be repeated in just
the same sense that a physical observation may be
repeated. Secondly, the observations are isolated;
they are made in a dark and quiet room, free from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
outside disturbance. No doubt, the observer’s thoughts
may wander in the intervals between observations. For
this reason, the experimenter gives a preconcerted signal,
or calls out <i>Now</i>, a second or two before a word is
shown; this signal warns the observer to pull himself
together and to free himself from any such distractions.
Thirdly, the observations are varied; for we employ all
sorts of words, both normally printed and variously
changed; and the stimuli may be presented for various
lengths of time. Here, then, is a true psychological
experiment; and if many observers, after many observations,
give the same account of their perceptive
experience, that account may stand as established psychological
fact.</p>

<p>Not all mental phenomena can be subjected to experiment
so neatly as this particular perception; and the
psychologist must still fall back, more often than he
likes, upon casual observation or imperfect experiments.
The reason is that <i>psychology has only recently become
an experimental science</i>. Common-sense psychology is
very old: we have a complete treatise in Greek from
the hand of Aristotle, and a text-book in Pali compiled
by some Buddhist sage, both dating from the fourth
century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> But while it is in the sixteenth century
of our era that the physicist abandons scholastic speculation
and begins to study nature by experiment, it is
not till the last quarter of the nineteenth that the psychologist
follows suit. In or about the year 1875 the
late Professor James, then instructor in anatomy and
physiology at Harvard, had a single room devoted to
psychological apparatus and experiments; and in 1879<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Professor Wundt opened at the University of Leipsic,
in a very modest way, the laboratory which has since
become the most famous in the world. It is true that
experiments in psychology had been made by individuals
long before laboratories were thought of; but the
same thing is true of physics and chemistry; and we
may remember, when we come to the weak places of
psychological exposition, that laboratory research and
instruction are not yet fifty years old.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c26" id="c26">§ 6</a>. <b>Process and Meaning.</b>&mdash;Science, we said on
p. 4, does not deal with values or meanings or uses,
but only with facts; and we have just seen how words,
which in everyday life are practically all meaning, may
be made the objects of psychological experiment. Still,
in their case, after all, we were simply ignoring meaning;
so far as the observer was able to read words at all
from the stimuli flashed on the screen, he read words
which had a meaning, and a meaning that the experimenter
might have discovered if he had been interested
in it. We have not offered any evidence that <b>mental
processes are not intrinsically meaningful</b>, that meaning
is not an essential aspect of their nature; we have
just assumed that they may be treated, scientifically,
as bare facts. Let us now see whether meaning is
essential to them or not. There are several heads of
evidence.</p>

<p>First, <i>meaning may be stripped from the mental process</i>
to which it normally belongs. Repeat aloud some word&mdash;the
first that occurs to you; <i>house</i>, for instance&mdash;over
and over again; presently the sound of the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
becomes meaningless and blank; you are puzzled and
a morsel frightened as you hear it. The same loss of
meaning is observed in pathological cases; there are
patients who can hear and see words as plainly as
you can, but who are unable to understand what they
hear and see; the bare perception is there, but it is
bereft of its meaning.</p>

<p>Secondly, a <i>meaningless experience may take on a
meaning</i>. A friend shows you a card, upon which is
scrawled a tangle of lines; you cannot make head or
tail of it. He tells you to look at the back; you see the
date there written; you think at once of a great earthquake;
you realise that the scrawl is a seismographic
record. Meaning has thus been attached or added to
a bare perception. Similarly, in learning a new script
or a new language, you attach meaning to what was at
first meaningless. The first experiments in the teaching
of the blind deaf-mute Laura Bridgman “were made by
pasting upon several common articles, such as keys,
spoon, knives, and the like, little paper labels on which
the name of the article had been printed in raised letters.”
These meaningless feels, as they were at the
outset, came presently to mean the objects with which
the teacher had connected them.</p>

<p>Thirdly, <i>an experience and its meaning may be disjoined
in time</i>. We often ask, in conversation, to have
a remark repeated; we have heard without understanding;
but before the speaker has time to repeat,
we ourselves begin to reply; the meaning has come, but
comes after an appreciable interval. So we may have
to wait a little while before we can recall the meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of some foreign word that nevertheless, as we say, we
know perfectly well. This disjunction is also found
in pathological cases. A patient “with slight stupor
could not answer questions except very slowly. She
was constantly saying: ‘I see everything, but I don’t
know anything.’ It took her five minutes to tell the
time when she was shown a clock.”</p>

<p>Here the experience comes first, and the meaning
follows after. This order may, however, be reversed.
You want to know the German of the proverb ‘Out of
the frying pan into the fire’; you have the meaning,
but you cannot think of the words; and presently the
words leap to mind, <i>aus dem Regen in die Traufe</i>, out
of the rain into the roof-drip. Or you know what you
want to say, but you cannot get this meaning into
words. An author who is very definitely aware of the
meaning he wishes to convey to his reader may nevertheless
have to write a paragraph ten or twenty times
over before the sight and sound of his own words give
back that meaning to himself. Or again, you may anticipate,
in listening to a lecture, the meaning of what the
lecturer is going to say, and yet you may be surprised
at the words which he actually uses.</p>

<p>Fourthly, <i>one and the same experience may have several
meanings</i>. Any dictionary is a proof of that!
A lecturer may demonstrate the fact to a class by drawing
on the blackboard, line by line, the figure of some such
thing as, for instance, a desk-telephone. As the drawing
proceeds, the lines may mean a pump, or a student
lamp, or an electric portable, or a railway semaphore,
or a jack, or various other things. In this case, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
be sure, a single meaning is given when the drawing is
complete; but there are plenty of experiences&mdash;a
bit of bad handwriting, a distant object, an obscure patch
in a painting&mdash;that leave us permanently unable to
decide among several meanings. How often do we
worry over a chance remark: it seemed to mean this,
but could it have meant that, or is it possible that it
really meant the other?</p>

<p>Fifthly, <i>one and the same meaning may attach to several
experiences</i>. You walk into a room, and there see
a table; you go into the same room in the dark and
hurt yourself, and you complain that you ran against
the table; you hear a noise overhead, and wish that the
maid would not drag that table about. Here the meaning
of a particular table is carried by three modes of
perceptive experience. In certain forms of mental disorder
one obsessing meaning colours all the experiences
of the daily life. The patient “scents poison and
treachery on all sides. He has slowly convinced himself
by numerous tests in little things that he is no longer
liked. The workmen are refractory and disobedient
with him more than with anyone else. His chiefs and
his fellows play malicious tricks upon him. His food
tastes differently, and does not agree with him. When
he goes to another town, it is plain that his enemies have
anticipated him by writing letters to his injury.”
Every experience that this man has means persecution.</p>

<p>Sixthly, <i>meaning and mental process are not covariants</i>.
Richness and fullness of experience do not necessarily
correspond with wealth of meaning; you may, in fact,
be bewildered, and fail to find a meaning just because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
there is so much material to take in; your first hearing
of a Wagner opera gave you, probably, more sound than
sense. Conversely, poverty of experience does not
necessarily mean loss or reduction of meaning; if that
were the case, we could not pack so much meaning into
such little things as words.</p>

<p>All this evidence would be greatly strengthened if
we went beyond the limits of individual experience, and
compared man with man, profession with profession,
race with race, age with age. What is meaningless to
me might be full of meaning to you; the same landscape
yields different meanings to the geologist and the
farmer; a protruded tongue means insult here, but
politeness in Thibet; the art of the telegrapher would
have spelled black magic a few centuries ago. Enough
has perhaps been said to give plausibility, at any rate,
to the statement that <b>mental processes do not intrinsically
mean</b>, that meaning is not a constituent part
of their nature; and that may suffice for the present;
we shall come back again to meaning later. Value and
use need hardly be discussed; they are, far more clearly
than meaning, additional to (and detachable from)
experience. If, however, the reader thinks that the
point should be worked out in their case also, he may put
them through the same sort of examination as that to
which we have just subjected meaning; evidence will
at once be forthcoming.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c30" id="c30">§ 7</a>. <b>The Scope of Psychology.</b>&mdash;Science, like the
Elephant’s Child in the story, is full of an insatiable
curiosity. Just as the physicist reaches out, analysing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and measuring, to the farthest limits of the stellar universe,
so does the psychologist seek to explore every
nook and corner of the world of mind; nay more, he
will follow after a mere suspicion of mind; we have
seen him trying to psychologise the plants. The result
is a vast number of books and monographs and articles
on psychology, written by men and women of very different
interests, knowledge and training; for science does
not advance on an ordered front, but still depends largely
on individual initiative. A high authority on the Middle
Ages has said that one mortal life would hardly suffice
for the reading of a moderate part of mediæval Latin;
and the psychologist must recognise, whether with pride
or with despair, that one life-time is hardly enough for
the mastery of even a single limited field of psychology.
The student has to get clear on general principles, and
then to resign himself to work intensively upon some
special aspect of the subject-matter,&mdash;keeping as
closely as he may in touch with his fellow-workers, and
aiming to see his own labours in a just perspective,
but realising that psychology as a whole is beyond his
individual compass.</p>

<p>Does that sound exaggerated? Let us then attempt
a rough classification! We begin with the <b>psychology
of the normal mind</b>. Under this heading we have to
distinguish (1) <i>human</i> psychology. Human psychology
may be <i>general</i>, the psychology of the adult civilised
man, which forms the principal topic of the text-books
of psychology; <i>special</i>, the psychology of the
human mind at some other stage of individual development:
infancy, childhood, adolescence, senility; <i>differential</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the study of the differences between individual
minds; or <i>genetic</i>, the study of the development of mind
from childhood to manhood, and its gradual decay in
old age. (2) <i>Animal</i> psychology may be subdivided,
in the same way, into general, special, differential and
genetic psychology. (3) <i>Plant</i> psychology is still in
its first beginnings; but many students are taking the
subject seriously. (4) <i>Comparative</i> psychology is the
comparative study, either of various types of animal
mind, or of the minds of plants, animals and man. It,
again, may be general, special or genetic.</p>

<p>All these psychologies deal with the <i>individual</i> mind.
There is also a <i>collective</i> psychology; and, though its
divisions are not yet sharply marked off from one
another, we may distinguish (5) <i>social</i> psychology,
which includes the study of what is called the social
consciousness, and also the scientific study of the products
of the collective mind: language, law and custom,
myth and religion; (6) <i>ethnic</i> psychology, the differential
psychology of nations or races; and (7) <i>class</i> psychology,
the differential psychology of classes or professions.</p>

<p>Turn now to the <b>psychology of the abnormal mind</b>.
Here we find, under the heading of <i>individual</i> psychology,
(8) the psychology of <i>deficient and exceptional
minds</i>; of blind deaf-mutism, of genius, of the subnormal
and the supernormal child; (9) the psychology of <i>temporary
mental derangement</i>; of dream, of hypnosis, of intoxications,
of occasional hallucination and illusion; and
(10) the psychology of <i>permanent mental disorder</i>, of
the chronic derangements of insanity. We may also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
study (11) the psychology of <i>temporary derangement</i>
of the <i>collective</i> mind, that is, of the manias or mental
epidemics that sometimes sweep society: the mediæval
dance-manias, unmotived panics, outbursts of superstition,
of religious persecution.</p>

<p>If we proceed further, from psychology proper to
<b>psychotechnics</b>, or to what is ordinarily termed applied
psychology, we have the great departments of (12)
<i>educational</i> psychology, (13) <i>medical</i> psychology or
psychotherapeutics, (14) <i>juristic</i> psychology, or the
psychology of evidence and testimony, and (15) <i>economic</i>
psychology, which includes such things as vocational
psychology and the psychology of advertising.</p>

<p>You need not ascribe any special importance to this
classification; still less need you memorise it. The
various topics might very likely be better arranged,
and the list is by no means complete. Realise, however,
that every term in the list has its text-books and treatises,
its manuals and monographs, and very likely its
magazine or magazines; realise again that, although
the emphasis varies in the different countries, the list
might be filled out not alone in English, but in all the
chief European tongues; and remember, lastly, that
some of the headings have a very long history, and a
correspondingly long series of printed works over and
above those that represent current knowledge. You
then get a glimmering of <b>the range and scope of psychology</b>.
It is true, of course, that much of what has
been printed is out of date, or inaccurate, or superficial,
or prejudiced, and for these or like reasons may safely
be scrapped. Yet it all has to be sifted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The mere bulk of psychological material would be less
formidable if every writer adopted the same principles and
wrote from the same point of view; but that is hardly to be
expected.</i> Psychology has always been exposed to the
infection of common sense; it has only recently turned
to scientific methods; and when the time came for it
to take its place among the sciences, there was naturally
difference of opinion regarding the standpoint it should
assume, the procedure it should follow, the model it
should seek to copy. Where such differences of opinion
obtain, the best way to begin your study is to <b>master
one system thoroughly</b>; your ideas are thus made consistent
and your knowledge receives an orderly arrangement;
then, as you read further, you can use this system
as a touch-stone whereby to test new ideas and to arrange
new knowledge; and if the new ideas seem preferable
to the old, or if the old framework breaks down under
the new knowledge, you can alter your own system accordingly.
If you begin, on the contrary, by studying
a number of works abreast, you are liable to become
confused. And it is better to be wrong than to be
muddled; for truth, as Bacon said, emerges more
quickly from error than from confusion.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c34" id="c34">§ 8</a>. <b>A Personal Word to the Reader.</b>&mdash;These introductory
sections are not easy. The only way to make
them easy would be, as an Irishman might say, to leave
the difficult things out; but then you would come to
the later chapters, where we study mental phenomena
in the concrete, with all sorts of prepossessions and misunderstandings;
psychology would be one long difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
instead of being, as it henceforth ought to be, a
bit of straight sailing.</p>

<p>So you must face the initial difficulty and overcome
it. Indeed, <b>you must do more than merely understand</b>.
The author’s undergraduates who break down in a
preliminary examination always explain that they followed
the lectures perfectly, and thought they understood
the text-book, but that they were somehow unable
to put things properly in their own words. The
author’s small daughter who comes home with an elaborate
example in compound interest explains, in the
same manner, that she thoroughly understood the rule
when She explained it, but that she can’t now see just
how to go to work for herself. It may be that these
excuses are not wholly reliable; they bear, at any rate,
upon the present point. You must not only understand
what you read as you read it; you must exercise your
thought upon what you have read; you must be able
to explain the paragraphs, in your own words, to others;
you must find instances and illustrations for yourself;
you must make the substance of the paragraphs a part
of your habitual mental furniture; you must note
how the old ways of thinking crop up to mislead you,
and must correct and criticise the natural man. In a
word, just as you practise your way into a language by
reading, translating, writing, speaking; or just as you
practise your way into algebra by doing exercise after
exercise until the rule seems to be part of you and applies
itself of its own accord; so must you <b>keep practising
your psychology</b> until it becomes instinctive. You
will gain some help by answering the appended questions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
but after the book has done all that it can for
you, the real induction into psychology remains to do
for yourself.</p>

<p>Some of the questions are concerned with forms of
expression; and you should take these very seriously,
since <i>language will be one of your greatest stumbling-blocks</i>.
Language is older than science, and has developed
under pressure of practical needs. Hence the
phrases that come most naturally to your lips may embody
a view of the world, or an attitude toward experience,
that is totally foreign to the scientific context.
If a visitor from Mars heard us all talking about the
sunset, what would he think of our knowledge of the
heavenly bodies? Yet we cannot escape from language;
and if Newton could express his ideas in Latin,
we ought to be able to express ours in English. It is a
good plan, at the start, to have your technical definitions
always at hand, and to try the effect of substituting these
definitions for the words that you have been using; if
the resulting clumsiness makes sense, you may let your
first expressions pass; but if not, you should try again.</p>

<p>You will notice, as you read on in the book, that back
references become numerous. Be advised to look these
references up! They send you, in every case, to a
particular page, so that their finding is easy, and you
can refresh your memory without any great loss of time;
though, for that matter, it will do no harm to glance
over the section in which they occur. If you, on your
part, want to refer to some past discussion, consult the
index; it has been made fairly full, and is meant to be
used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc2"><b><a name="c37" id="c37">Questions and Exercises</a></b></p>

<p class="p1">Many of the books to which you will be referred, now and
later, have appeared in numerous editions, library and
popular, English and American. The references are made so
complete that you will easily find the corresponding passages
in editions other than those used by the author.</p>

<p class="p1">(1) Discuss the following definitions of science. If you
have access to the books, read the passages in which the definitions
occur; if not, do the best you can with your present
knowledge. Try to see a reason even for the definitions
that you cannot accept.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Science is perfected common sense (Huxley). The
definition accords with the view of Spencer that science and
ordinary knowledge are allied in nature, and that the one is
but a perfected and extended form of the other. What is
there in the common interests of these two men, or in the
period in which they lived, to account for such a definition?</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Reduced to its lowest terms, science is the observation
of phenomena and the colligation of the results of observation
into groups (Hill).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) When may any subject be said to enter the scientific
stage? I suppose when the facts of it begin to resolve themselves
into groups; when phenomena are no longer isolated
experiences, but appear in connection and order; when,
after certain antecedents, certain consequents are uniformly
seen to follow; when facts enough have been collected to
furnish a basis for conjectural explanation, and when conjectures
have so far ceased to be utterly vague, that it is
possible in some degree to foresee the future by the help of
them (Froude).</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Mechanics is the science of motion; and its problem
is to describe the motions that occur in nature <i>completely</i>
and <i>in the simplest way</i> (Kirchhoff). Can this definition of

<p>(<i>a</i>) The savage thinker seems to have taken for granted, as
a matter of course, the ordinary operations of his own mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
It hardly occurred to him to think about the machinery
of thinking (Tylor).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The modern mind is, what the ancient mind was not,
brooding and self-conscious; and its meditative self-consciousness
has discovered depths in the human soul which
the Greeks and Romans did not dream of, and would not
have understood (Mill).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) When to save his own soul became man’s first business,
he must needs know that soul, must study, must examine it.
Prescribed as a duty, introspection became at once a main
characteristic of religious life (Burr).</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) There is nothing more interesting to the ordinary individual
than the workings of his own mind. This interest
alone would justify the existence of the science [of psychology]
(Pillsbury).</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) If we could say in English ‘it thinks’, as we say ‘it
rains’ or ‘it blows’, we should be stating the fact most simply
and with the minimum of assumption (James).</p>

<p class="p1">(5) What is the earliest notion of your own mind that you
can recall?</p>

brocade, white silk, light mauve, and sea-green with cream or
ivory sheen on it. How could this difference of report
have arisen?</p>


<p>(7) Newton is said to have discovered the law of gravitation
by observing the fall of an apple from a bough. Was
this a simple observation, or could it be said to have anything
of the experiment about it?</p>


<p>(8) What are the characteristics of a good observer? of a
good experimenter?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>


<p>(9) The older psychologies speak, in technical terms,
not of mental processes but of powers, faculties, capacities
of the mind. What view of mind do these expressions
imply?</p>


<p>(10) Rousseau remarked that definitions would be all
very well if we did not use words to make them; <i>les définitions
pourraient être bonnes si l’on n’employait pas des mots pour
les faire</i> (Œuvres complètes de J. J. Rousseau: Émile, tome
i., 1823, livre ii., 160). Illustrate this remark by reference
to psychology.</p>


<p>(11) Try to describe your experience on some occasion
which leads you to say: (<i>a</i>) I have made up my mind;
(<i>b</i>) I have half a mind to do so-and-so; (<i>c</i>) That puts me in
mind of so-and-so. Try to get down to the bare facts; it
will be difficult; but try again and again, and do not be
satisfied to report meanings.</p>


<p>(12) Describe your fountain-pen from the points of view
of common sense, of physics, and of psychology. Do not
attempt too much detail, but get the differences in point
of view clearly on paper.</p>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Sensation</span></p>

<p class="psh">Now that these points have been determined, let us proceed to a
general discussion of the whole subject of Sensation.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Aristotle</span></p>

<p>§ 9. <b>Sensations from the Skin.</b>&mdash;The skin is part
of our organic birthright. One of the great differences
between the living and the not-living lies in the possession
of a skin; stone and iron weather and rust, but
even the naked amœba has its ectosarc, and flowers of
tan their plasmoderm. The skin is also the oldest of
the sense-organs, and the mother of all the rest; how
old, we dare hardly guess; but we know that the chemical
elements which make up living tissue took form
early in the history of our planet, earlier than the heavy
metals. So it is natural to begin our survey of sensations
by questioning the skin.</p>

<p>The skin is a shifty witness; and to get positive answers,
we must literally cross-examine it; we must go
over its surface point by point and line by line, with all
sorts of mechanical and thermal and electrical and
chemical stimuli. The outcome is a little surprising;
we find only <b>four sensations, pressure, cold, warmth
and pain</b>. The organs of these sensations are dotted
in a sort of irregular mosaic all over the skin, and the
intervening spaces are insensitive. The organs of pressure,
distributed over about 95% of the bodily surface,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
are nerve-skeins twined about the roots of the hairs;
on the hairless areas of the body, we find the nerve-skein
by itself. The organ of pain is probably a little brush-like
bunch of nerve-fibrils just below the epidermis.
The organs of warmth and cold are certainly distinct;
the sensations are not degrees of one sensation, as the
thermometer might lead us to suppose; but the precise
nature of their nerve-endings has not yet been made
out.</p>

<p>You may easily find pressure spots by fastening a
short horsehair with sealing-wax at right angles to the
end of a match, and applying the horsehair point to the
back of the hand above a hair-bulb, that is, just to windward
of the issuing hair; dot the horsehair about, here
and there, till the sensation flashes up. You may find
cold spots by passing the blunt point of a lead pencil
slowly across the closed eyelid. Warm spots are more
difficult to demonstrate. For pain, take the shaft of a
pin loosely between finger and thumb of the right hand,
and bring the point down sharply on the back of the
left hand; you get two sensations; the first is a pressure,
the second&mdash;which pricks or stings&mdash;is a pain.</p>

<p>As a rule, these organs are not stimulated separately
but in groups. Itch, for instance, is due to the light
stimulation of a field of pain-endings, and superficial
tickle to that of a field of pressure-organs. The experience
of <b>heat</b>, curiously enough, is a blend of warmth
and cold; there are no heat spots. It may be observed
in this way: if you apply a surface of increasing warmth
to a region of the skin which has both cold and warm
spots, you feel for some time only the warmth; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
when the stimulus has reached a certain temperature,
the cold spots, suddenly and paradoxically, flash out
their sensations of cold; and the blend of warmth and
of paradoxical cold is felt as heat. Cement a smooth
copper coin to a handle, and apply it at gradually increasing
temperature to the middle of the forehead just
under the hair; you will presently find the heat. Or if
you cannot do that, note the shiver of cold when you
next step into an overhot bath.</p>

<p>When we compare these results with the show that
the skin makes as a sense-organ in everyday life, we
can hardly help bringing against it the charge of dishonesty.
The pressure spots give us tickle, contact or
light pressure, and pressure proper; the pain spots,
itch, prick or sting, and pain proper. The cold spots
give cold and cool, the warm spots lukewarm and warm;
cold and warm spots together give heat; cold and pain
give biting cold; cold and warm and pain give burning
or scalding heat; and that is all. Yet the skin pretends
to tell us of hard and soft, wet and dry, light and
heavy, rough and smooth, yielding and resistant, sharp
and blunt, clammy and greasy, oily and sticky, stiff and
elastic, and so on. Where do we get all these experiences?</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c45" id="c45">§ 10</a>. <b>Kinæsthetic Sensations.</b>&mdash;We get them, for
the most part, from the cooperation with the skin
of certain deeper-lying tissues. Psychologists have long
suspected the existence of a muscle sense. We now
know that sensations are derived, not only from the
<b>muscles</b>, but also from the <b>tendons</b> and the capsules of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the <b>joints</b>. These tissues are, of course, closely bound
together, and are all alike affected by movement of a
limb or of the body. Their disentanglement, from the
point of view of sensation, has been a slow and difficult
matter. Psychology has here been greatly aided by
pathology; for there are diseases in which the skin
alone is insensitive, in which skin and muscles alone are
insensitive, and in which the whole limb is insensitive;
so that a first rough differentiation is made for us by
nature herself. It is also possible artificially to anæsthetise
muscle and joint; and psychologists have
devised various forms of experiment whereby some single
tissue is thrown into relief above the others.</p>

<p>Not only, however, are the sensations of these tissues
aroused by movement; they also form the sensory basis
of our perception of the movement of body and limbs.
For this reason they have been named <b>kinæsthetic</b>, or
movement-perceiving. They are of the following kinds.</p>

<p>First, we have from the muscles the sensation of physical
<b>fatigue</b>. If the skin over a muscle is rendered
anæsthetic, and the muscle is thrown into forced contraction
by an electric current, we have, to begin with, a
dull dead pressure; as time goes on, or if the strength of
the current is increased, this pressure becomes dragging,
the sensation of fatigue; and finally it becomes sore
and achy, and passes over into dull pain. From the
tendons we get a sensation which, when we are actively
pushing or pulling, we call <b>effort</b>, and when we are
passively holding or resisting we call <b>strain</b>; it, too,
passes over into pain. Lastly, from the joints we have a
<b>pressure</b>: something like the pressure you feel if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
smear the right forefinger with vaseline, and turn it
in the loosely closed left hand. Take a piece of elastic
between the forefingers and thumbs; pull it out, and
then relax it; at the moment of relaxation there is a
pressure in the finger-joints, which is the specific joint-sensation.</p>

<p><i>Muscle and joint, then, yield sensations which are like
those of pressure on the skin; and muscle and tendon
yield sensations which are like those of pain from the
skin</i>; it is small wonder that the skin, the only portion
of this whole sensory apparatus that is open to view,
should ordinarily be credited with the entire number.
In point of fact, there are very few of the experiences
listed on p. 45 that do not imply the cooperation of some
or all of the deeper-lying organs, the nerve-spindles of
muscle and tendon and the nerve-corpuscles of the
joints. Those that really belong to the skin owe their
specific character to the context in which they are set;
they change their meaning as a particular word changes
its meaning from one sentence to another; think of
the horribly clammy feel of a bit of cold boiled potato
as you set your finger on it in the dark, and of its totally
different feel when you have turned the light on and see
what it is you are touching! Wetness, for instance,
proves on analysis to be a complex of pressure and
temperature; it is possible, when the observer does not
know the nature of the stimulus, to arouse the feel of
wet from perfectly dry things, such as powder, or cotton
wool, or bits of metal; and it is possible to wet the
observer’s hand with water and yet to arouse the feel
only of a dry pressure or a dry warmth or cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>So our very first adventure in psychology brings out,
as clearly as we need wish, the <i>difference between science
and common sense</i>. The skin is really living upon borrowed
capital; it has added to its own sensations those
derived from the subjacent tissues; but common sense,
blind to what it cannot see, ascribes to it a ‘sense of
touch’ that includes everything and examines nothing.
More than this, common sense fails to draw the distinction
between process and meaning which we discussed
in § 6, and therefore ascribes to the sense of touch a
variety of sensory experience that far outruns the facts.
Hardness and softness and stickiness and oiliness and
the rest are, no doubt, separate and distinct as meanings;
but when we analyse the corresponding experiences, we
find only the half-dozen sensations mentioned above.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c48" id="c48">§ 11</a>. <b>Taste and Smell.</b>&mdash;The great physiologist
Carl Ludwig once remarked that smell is the most unselfish
of all the senses; it gives up everything it has to
taste, and asks nothing in return. Taste is, indeed, an
inveterate borrower; it borrows from smell and from
touch, very much as the skin borrows from the underlying
organs. When we have a cold in the head, we
say that we cannot taste; but how is taste affected?
The truth is that our nose is stopped, and we cannot smell.</p>

<p>If the surface of the <b>tongue</b> is explored with various
sorts of stimuli, and the nose is kept out of function
by plugging of the nostrils, we find <b>four sensations:
sweet, bitter, sour, and salt</b>. Think, then, how much
‘taste’ there would be in the meats and vegetables that
deck our tables, if the nose were closed and condiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
were not added! The sensation of sweet is strongest
at the tip of the tongue; bitter at the root; sour along
the sides; salt is fairly evenly distributed over all three
areas; the middle region of the tongue is insensitive to
taste. The sensory cells are grouped in flask-shaped
structures, the taste-buds or taste-beakers, which are
again gathered together in or about the papillæ of the
tongue’s surface; some of these you can see, as red specks
upon the dull pink mucous membrane, if you look at
the tip of your tongue in a glass. There is only one
instance of a blend of tastes; if sweet and salt are mixed,
there appears a new taste, flat or vapid in character.
Apart from these five things&mdash;sweet, bitter, sour, salt,
vapid,&mdash;we ‘taste’ entirely by smell or touch.</p>

<p><b>Smell</b>, on the other hand, <b>has more sensations than
we can count or name</b>; more sensations, probably,
than all the rest of our senses put together. We can
make out certain great groups of odours: flower, fruit,
spicy, musky, leek, burned, rank, foul, nauseous; we
may take as examples vanilla, orange, cinnamon, sandalwood,
onion, toast, cheese, opium, garbage. Realise
that the flower odours comprise the scents of all the
flowers, as well as those of vanilla, tea, hay, and suchlike
things; or that the spicy odours comprise the scents of
all the spices, as well as those of thyme, geranium,
bergamot, cedarwood, and suchlike things; and you will
get some idea of the variety of the world of smell. When
we add that odours freely blend or combine to give new
scents, you will understand that the number of smell
sensations is enormous.</p>

<p>The sensory cells are found in two patches of mucous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
membrane, each about as big as the little-finger nail,
which lie saddle-wise across the blind top of the nasal
cavities. They cannot be stimulated directly; but
particles carried into the outer nostrils by the breath-stream,
or into the inner nostrils by the air-stream thrown
back in the act of swallowing, eddy upward to them and
thus arouse sensation. The second mode of stimulation
plays, of course, into the hands of taste; we think
we <i>taste</i> when we swallow; we forget that we have inner
nostrils, though we know very well that we can sniff
up a lotion and bring it down into the back of the
mouth. But though the stimulation is thus indirect,
the cells are extraordinarily sensitive; a mere trace of
odorous substance will set up a sensation; and the nose
is also keenly discriminative.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of the tens of thousands of sensations,
and in spite of the extraordinary sensitivity of the
cells, we often read that in man the sense of smell is
degenerating! Of this there is not one particle of evidence.
We could not, truly, live by smell, as dogs do;
but then men have never been dogs; and even so there
are cases on record&mdash;among the Botocudos of Brazil
and the aboriginal tribes of the Malay peninsula&mdash;of
savage hunters who track their game by scent.
There is no atom of evidence that, since man was man,
his sense of smell has degenerated. It is true, on the
other hand, that <b>the sense of smell has fallen into disuse</b>.
The reason is that smell is essentially a ground
sense, as you may convince yourself any summer day
that you lie out on the grass, or any time that you
are willing to spend a few minutes on a dining-room floor;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
birds in general have a very obtuse sense of smell, and
many of them perhaps lack sensations of smell altogether.
When, then, mankind assumed the upright
position, and the nostrils were lifted several feet above
the surface of the ground, the sense was removed from
its normal environment, and fell into disuse; sight and
hearing took its place. But it may still be used. The
late Sir Francis Galton, a cousin of Darwin’s, once made
an essay, for instance, at an <b>arithmetic by smell</b>;
peppermint stood for one, camphor for two, carbolic
acid for three, and so on. “There was not the slightest
difficulty in banishing all visual and auditory images
from the mind, leaving nothing in consciousness besides
real or imaginary scents. In this way I convinced myself
of the possibility of doing sums in simple addition
with considerable speed and accuracy solely by means
of imaginary scents. Subtraction succeeded as well as
addition.” Needless to say, it is not worth our while
to do this sort of work; the very fact that odours have
no settled system of names, like cold or pain, red or
blue, shows that they have not been utilized in human
life. It is fair to add, also, that sight and hearing are
better suited than smell to our everyday needs; for
smells very soon fade out and disappear; indeed, if
they did not, the work of garbage collectors or of medical
students in the dissecting room would be permanently
disagreeable.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c51" id="c51">§ 12</a>. <b>Sensations from the Ear.</b>&mdash;Sensations of
hearing fall into two great groups, tones and noises.
When we are speaking of <b>tones</b>, we naturally think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the keyboard of a piano. The piano tones are, in reality,
not simple tones or sensations but compound tones;
and we are able, after a little practice, to break up a
compound tone into its simple constituents. You may
get a fair notion of a really simple tone by blowing gently
across the mouth of an empty bottle. The tone is
dull and hollow, as compared with the bright solidity
of a piano tone, but it has also a pleasant mellowness.
With these two aids, the bottle tone and the piano keyboard,
we may approach our study of tonal sensations.</p>

<p>Tones have, first of all, the character that we call
<b>pitch</b>; they lie, that is, up or down in the scale; they
belong to the bass or the treble or to a middle region.
The word ‘pitch’ means height; it is a term borrowed
from perceptions of sight; and we cannot yet say certainly
how it came to be applied to tones. Secondly,
tones have the character of <b>volume</b>,&mdash;another borrowed
word! The highest note on the piano seems
shrunken, narrowed, pointed, as compared with the
deepest note in the bass; and the difference comes out
even more clearly with bottle tones. Thirdly, tones
show a sort of recurrence. If you run your finger-nail
quickly up the keyboard in a <i>glissando</i>, you perceive
a change only of pitch and volume; but if you play the
notes <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i> in one octave and then in another and then
in a third, you realise that all the sequences are alike;
we talk, indeed, of playing the <i>same</i> notes in <i>different</i>
octaves. This recurring character of tones is called
<b>tonality</b>.</p>

<p>It has recently been stated that tones have a further
character, that of <b>vocality</b>. Consider the series of vowels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
U, O, A, E, I (voiced approximately as in the words
<i>moot</i>, <i>moat</i>, <i>mart</i>, <i>mate</i>, <i>meet</i>); there is no doubt that
U suggests a low bottle tone, and I a high whistle tone.
Experiments seem to show that, as we go up the scale,
the tones say M-M, U, O, A, E, I, S-S, F-F, CH (the
sound in the Scotch <i>loch</i>); and, curiously enough, that
they say these things at intervals of an octave; so that,
when we have found a pure O, we find the pure A just
an octave higher, and the tones that lie between give
Oa, OA, oA, according to their position. The question
is still in debate; for these experiments are opposed by
others, and the whole subject of the nature of vowel-sounds
is very thorny. It is quite clear that high and
low tones sound definitely like U and I; but some of the
other vowels are far less distinct; and the point of
change from vowel to vowel does not appear to be as
sharp and precise as the first experiments indicated.
On the whole, <i>we shall do best to suspend judgement</i>.</p>

<p>There are some ten thousand simple tones in the
complete tonal scale; but the compound tones employed
by music are only about a hundred in number,
and are selected from a middle range of hearing. The
compound tone, as we have said, breaks up on analysis
into simple partial tones; the lowest is called the <b>fundamental</b>,
the others the <b>overtones</b>. It is a remarkable
fact that the overtones always stand in a definite relation
to the fundamental. The various musical instruments
do not, however, sound all the overtones alike;
their construction favours some, and weakens or destroys
others; and that is the main reason why we can
tell a harp-tone, for instance, from a tone of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
pitch played on oboe or trumpet. The compound
tones thus owe their <b>colour</b> or <b>timbre</b>, in the first instance,
to <i>the number and relative loudness of the overtones
which accompany the fundamental</i>. Timbre has
other factors; but this is the primary source of difference.</p>

<p><i>Overtones may readily be heard.</i> Strike a <i>c</i>, very
lightly, on the piano. When it has ceased to sound,
strike loudly the <i>c</i> next below; you can probably,
even at the first trial, hear the higher <i>c</i> in the lower.
Now strike very lightly the <i>g</i> next above your higher
<i>c</i>, and then the lower <i>c</i> again loudly; you will probably
hear the <i>g</i>. Helmholtz, working with thin strings,
was able to hear no less than fifteen overtones with
the fundamental.</p>

<p>This blending of the partial tones in a compound tone,
to give a single and unitary impression, is an example of
what is called <b>tonal fusion</b>. The best fusion is that of
two tones which constitute an octave; here, indeed,
the blend is so close that it is often confused with unison;
a soprano and a bass singer, told to sing in unison,
will start off without hesitation an octave apart. Next
after the octave stands the fifth (<i>c</i> and <i>g</i>); boys who
think they are whistling the same notes often whistle,
in fact, a fifth apart. Other pairs of tones give lesser
degrees of fusion.</p>

<p><i>Tones generate as well as blend.</i> If you sound together
two high tones, such as you get from a double
bicycle whistle, or from small bottles of different sizes,
you hear, besides these tones themselves, a third tone,
very much deeper, larger, more booming; this <b>differential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
tone</b> is easy to find and, once heard, cannot be
mistaken. Only, the two tones must not be too nearly
alike in pitch; for, if they are, you hear, instead of a
differential tone, slow surges or quick rattlings of sound.
Take two bottles of the same size, and mistune one of
them by pouring in small amounts of water; have them
blown steadily together; the course of the <b>beats</b>, as
they are called, from a slow surge through a rattle to a
harsh blur, may thus be followed.</p>

<p><b>Noises</b>, which form a class of sensations distinct from
tones, are nevertheless aroused by the same sort of
stimuli. If a tonal stimulus is sounded for a very brief
time, we hear a dry knock; if a large number of tonal
stimuli are sounded all at once, we hear a buzz or crash.
Noises have <b>pitch</b>; the spit of a pistol is higher than the
crack of a rifle, and the sizzle of frying fat is higher than
the murmur of falling rain; but no one has yet established
a complete scale of noise.</p>

<p><i>The sensory cells are found in the inner ear</i>, a tiny
structure with an extremely complicated mechanism.
Many different views of its action have been put forward.
That which is most generally accepted was
proposed by the German physicist H. von Helmholtz.
<i>The ear contains a narrow triangular membrane which
carries many thousands of stiffish cross-fibres</i>; and the
theory is that the air-waves which impinge on the outer
ear play, selectively, upon these fibres; <i>every air-wave
throws into vibration the fibre which is tuned to respond to
it</i>. A compound tonal stimulus is thus analysed by the
membrane into a number of simple tonal stimuli, and
every simple stimulus excites the nerve-fibril attached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to its particular cross-fibre. This theory explains our
ability to analyse compound tones into their simple
components.</p>

<p><i>The ear is, however, more than an organ of hearing.</i>
It includes organs, of a very ancient type, which help
to regulate our balance in walking, our precision in
turning corners or avoiding obstacles, and so on. Each
ear, for instance, has three little organs that resemble
minute spirit-levels, set in the three planes of space,
and that give us the sensation of ‘swimming’ when the
head is sharply jerked, and the sensation of <b>dizziness</b>
when we twirl on our heels. For the most part these
organs act reflexly, without furnishing sensations; or
at any rate furnish sensations of little strength, and of
a pressure-like kind that blends indistinguishably with
the kinæsthetic sensations from the tissues beneath the
skin; but in the cases mentioned the swimmy, dizzy
sensation may be noticed.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c56" id="c56">§ 13</a>. <b>Sensations from the Eye.</b>&mdash;You may study
tones by help of the piano and a few medicine bottles;
but for the study of lights and colours you must go
beyond household appliances, and secure a fairly large
set of coloured and grey papers; sample-books may be
obtained, very cheaply, from the manufacturers. You
will notice, first of all, that as the world of sounds divides
into tones and noises, so does the world of looks
divide into what we have just called colours and lights.
The colourless looks or <b>lights</b> may be arranged in a single
straight line that passes from purest white through the
greys to deepest black; they are, as sensations, older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
than colours, just as noise is older than tone. <b>Colours</b>
are more varied. Consider, to begin with, the character
of colour proper or <b>hue</b>, that is, the differences
of colour that show in the rainbow. Hues may be
arranged, not in one straight line, but in a square.
Setting out, say, from red, you pass through red-yellow
or orange to yellow; that is one straight line; setting
out again from yellow, you pass through yellow-green
to green; from green you pass through green-blue to
blue; and finally from blue you come back, by way of
blue-red (violet and purple), to the original red. Colours
have, besides, two further characters, that bring
them into relation with lights. They differ in <b>tint</b>,
that is, in darkness or lightness; brown is darker than
yellow, sky-blue is lighter than navy-blue. They differ
also in saturation or <b>chroma</b>, that is, in poorness or richness
of hue; pinks and yellows look faded and washed-out
as compared with rich reds and blues. <i>Tint brings
colours into relation with lights</i>, because, if we can say
that a colour is darker or lighter than a particular grey,
we can also find some grey that matches it in darkness or
lightness; and <i>chroma brings colours into relation with
lights</i>, in the sense that the better chroma is farther off
from colourlessness (that is, from grey) than the poorer
chroma of the same hue and tint.</p>

<p><i>All lights and colours are psychologically simple.</i>
Paints may be mixed on a palette, and colour-stimuli
may be mixed in all sorts of ways; we learn in physics
that white daylight is a mixture of all the rays that are
seen separately in the rainbow. Yet a white, considered
just as a look, is perfectly simple; and the looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of orange and yellow-green and green-blue are equally
simple. There are no compound colours, to correspond
with compound tones. Hence the number of light and
colour sensations is very large, at least ten times as
large as the number of simple tones.</p>

<p>The organ of vision is the eye; and <i>the eye is a little
photographic camera</i>, with shutter, iris-diaphragm, self-adjusting
lens, dark chamber, and self-renewing sensitive
film. We are concerned only with the film, that is,
with the <b>retina</b> or nervous network that lines the posterior
half of the eyeball. It seems that <i>the retina is
really made up of three interfused films</i>; for simplicity’s
sake you may consider them as lying upon one another,
just as three saucers might do if you piled them together.
The oldest and largest film, the bottom saucer,
gives us the sensations of <i>black and white</i>; the middlemost,
somewhat smaller, gives us <i>blue and yellow</i>; and
the topmost and smallest gives us a <i>purplish-red and a
bluish-green</i>. The existence and size of the three films
can be shown by experiment; for we are all totally
colour-blind at the edge of the field of vision, and are
blind to reds and greens for some distance further in
toward the centre. There are also cases of inherited
<b>colour-blindness</b>, in which the eye is blind either for
all colours (total colour-blindness) or for red and green
alone (partial colour-blindness); the latter form is fairly
common, as is natural,&mdash;for the red-green film, being
the last to come, might be expected to be the first to go.
Partial colour-blindness was first brought to scientific
notice by the English chemist John Dalton in 1798.
Dalton was a Quaker, but made no objection to wearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the scarlet gown of a doctor of laws, because, as he said,
“to me its colour is that of nature&mdash;the colour of those
green leaves”; it is needless to remark that he did not
see green either! The defect is practically important
for pilots and signalmen, who have to distinguish red
and green lights.</p>

<p><i>From these three films we get all the lights and colours
that we see in the daytime, with the single exception of</i>
<b>neutral grey</b>; and this appears to come, not from the
eye at all, but from the brain. It may be seen even
when the retina is quite blind, provided that the rest
of the nervous apparatus is in working order; and it
may be seen by night as well as by day; it is mixed,
physiologically, with all our sensations of light and
colour, though we cannot by psychological analysis
pick it out from the lights and colours. Strange enough!
but we shall understand better as we go on. The German
physiologist Ewald Hering has shown that <i>the
processes which take place in the films are, in all probability,
chemical processes of an</i> <b>antagonistic</b> <i>or</i> <b>reversible</b>
<i>kind</i>; that is why we never see a bluish-yellow, or a
greenish-red; if we throw on the same part of the retina,
at the same time, equal amounts of black and white,
or of blue and yellow, or of purplish-red and bluish-green,
the chemical processes go on in opposite directions
and cancel each other, with the result that we see
just nothing. This antagonism can be proved, under
the right experimental conditions, for blue-yellow and
for red-green; if these pairs are fittingly thrown together
on the retina we see, in fact, only neutral grey;
so that our seeing of the same grey, when black and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
white stimuli are acting together, does not necessarily
mean that grey is a retinal mixture of black and white;
the black and white may also cancel each other, and
leave only the brain-grey to be seen.</p>

<p>We have, then, the three films in each eyeball, and
we have the brain-grey behind them. More than this:
we have a night or <b>twilight eye</b>. When colours fade out,
as twilight deepens, another retinal film comes into
play; the lights that we still see come, not from the
black-white film, but from a fourth film, of the same
size, whose only sensation is <i>a slightly bluish-white</i>. Of
course, this white is always mixed, physiologically,
with the brain-grey; we never see it by itself; but we
owe to it, among other things, the silvery look of blues
in the twilight. The very centre of the twilight eye is
totally blind; if on a moonless night you want to see a
faint star or a distant street-lamp you must not look
directly at it, but just to one side of it. Children’s
fear of the dark is partly due to the fact that they
cannot see what they turn their gaze upon; there
had seemed to be something there, but when they
looked at it, it eluded them; and if they think they
see it again, and look in the new direction, again it
is gone.</p>

<p>Now suppose that you are looking out, in daylight,
over a variegated landscape. Somewhere or other you
see a patch of light grey. You get this sensation from
the black-white film and the brain-grey; the white-process
is stronger than the black-process in the film,
and the excess of white, added physiologically to the
brain-grey, shows as light grey. Or again, you see a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
patch of dark purple. This sensation comes from the
red-green film (excess of red); from the blue-yellow film
(excess of blue); from the black-white film (excess of
black); and from the brain-grey. All the lights and
colours of the landscape can be accounted for in the
same way.</p>

<p>Not quite correctly, however!&mdash;there are still other
factors at work. <i>The film-processes are antagonistic</i>,
for instance, <i>even when they go on in different parts of a
film</i>; lights and colours <b>contrast</b> with one another; if
you lay a strip of grey paper on red, it looks greenish;
on blue, yellowish; on white, blackish; make the trial
with your own papers. So all the various lights and
colours of the landscape stand out, by contrast, against
one another; the eye makes their differences greater
than they ought physically, from the nature of the
stimuli, to appear. <i>Black, indeed, is wholly a contrast-sensation</i>;
it has no physical stimulus; and you see deep
black only in strong illumination.</p>

<p>Contrast is effective at once, the moment you cast
your eyes on the landscape. <i>As time goes on</i>, however,
<i>the opposed film-processes tend to settle down into a
state of balance or equilibrium</i>; so that actually, if you
stared at the landscape long enough, without moving
your eyes, you would finally see nothing but the brain-grey.
This levelling down of all lights and all colours
toward neutral grey is called <b>adaptation</b>. Stand up
two strips of black and white paper, side by side, and
stare at their line of junction for a minute or two; even
in that short time you will find that they tend toward
a uniform grey. If, now, a stimulus to which you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
wholly or partly adapted is suddenly removed, the
antagonism of the film-processes shows itself once
more; you see an <b>after-image</b>. Lay a disc of red on
grey; stare at it for half a minute; flick it away, keeping
the eyes steady, and look at the grey background;
you see a corresponding disc of green. White leaves a
black after-image, black a white; blue a yellow after-image,
and yellow a blue.</p>

<p>It is clear, then, that <i>the lights and colours of the landscape
depend on many things beside the stimuli there
presented</i>; they depend on contrast, on the previous
adaptation of the eye, on the presence or absence of
after-images. The main reason that we do not notice
all these influences is that we ordinarily view the landscape,
not for itself, but for what it means; it shows us
the familiar trees and stream and houses, and we take
their stability for granted. That is the main reason;
it is not the only one. We have said, for instance, that
the normal retina is totally colour-blind along its outer
edge, and partially colour-blind for some distance in
toward the centre; <i>the edge of the landscape ought therefore
to be colourless</i>, and a certain outlying portion of it
ought to appear simply as blue and yellow. There is
no hint of these differences; and the explanation is
that we are accustomed to turn our eyes directly towards
what we want to see, and therefore to view it with all
three of the daylight films; head and eyes <b>move</b> so easily,
and we see so much better with the centre of the retina,
that we totally disregard the altered look of things seen
‘out of the corner of the eye.’ Even if we do not, we
are likely to <i>remember</i> how the things appear in direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
vision; we paint them over, so to speak, with <b>memory-colours</b>,
colours that represent their natural or average
appearance at the centre of the visual field; indeed,
we may <i>paint these colours over the whole landscape, and
in that way correct the changes due to contrast or adaptation</i>.
We always talk of a certain book as brown; we recognise
it in all lights, and in all states of the eye, by its
brown colour; we <i>see</i> it, in memory-colour, as brown;
whereas, if that same brown were shown us in all the
different circumstances without our knowing it to be
the same, it might give us sensations of yellow, of pale
brown, of deep brown, of black. These two factors,
<i>movement of the eyes and memory-colour</i>, lead us to overlook,
in great part, the actual variation of lights and
colours in the landscape.</p>

<p>A final word may be added regarding <i>the likeness of
sight and smell</i>. Odours and colours fade out by adaptation;
odours, like lights and colours, contrast, and
even cancel one another; and smell-stimuli as well as
sight-stimuli mix to produce new and simple sensations.
It is highly probable that the sensory cells of smell are
the seat of only a few chemical processes, by whose
combination all the wealth of odours is created, just as
the cone-cells of the retina are the seat of those three
reversible processes (black-white, blue-yellow, red-green)
whose combination endows us with the variety of
daylight vision. We have as yet, however, no such
definite grounds for hypothesis as we have in the case
of sight; we cannot even guess what these processes
are, or how many of them are taking place in the smell-membrane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c64" id="c64">§ 14</a>. <b>Organic Sensations.</b>&mdash;There are still other
sensations, coming to us from the internal bodily organs;
from various parts of the alimentary canal, from the
organs of sex, from heart and blood-vessels, from the
lungs, from the sheathing membrane of the bones; but
it is doubtful if they are of new kinds; probably they
consist simply of <b>pressure</b>, <b>cold</b>, <b>warmth</b>, and <b>pain</b>.
The dull deep-seated pains that we call <b>aches</b> are,
perhaps, different from the bright pains of the skin;
but most of the differences among pains, differences
that we express by the terms lancing, throbbing, piercing,
stabbing, thrilling, gnawing, boring, shooting, racking,
and so on, are either differences of time (steady,
intermittent) or space (localised, diffused) or degree
(moderate, acute), or else are differences due to the
blending of pain with various other sensations.</p>

<p>The organic sensations, like the kinæsthetic, tend
thus to occur in groups or complexes, and we have as
yet no very sure means of disentangling them. It is,
nevertheless, quite clear that in their case, as in that of
the touch-blends, we have to <i>distinguish between experience
and meaning</i>. <b>Hunger</b> and <b>nausea</b> seem, for example,
to be very different; yet the core of both turns
out on analysis to be the same dull pain; and we know
that the onset of a bilious attack is often heralded by an
unusually keen appetite, so that the beginnings of nausea
are in fact confused with a growing hunger. The difference
between hunger and nausea is due partly to a
difference in the processes which ordinarily accompany
the central pain,&mdash;motor restlessness or lassitude in the
case of hunger, and dizziness in that of nausea; but more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
especially to a difference of meaning or interpretation;
hunger stands for want of food, and nausea for indigestion.</p>

<p>We shall see later that <i>organic sensations play a large
part in emotion, as kinæsthetic sensations do in perception</i>.
Plato set the ‘spirited’ or ‘passionate’ part of the soul
in the breast; the Psalms abound in phrases that suggest
the same idea; we speak to-day of the <i>heart</i> coming
up to the mouth, or dropping to the boots. So we
read in the Old Testament that Joseph’s <i>bowels</i> yearned
upon his brother, and in the New Testament of bowels
of compassion; and the inner stir that the writers have
in mind is familiar to everybody.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c65" id="c65">§ 15</a>. <b>Sensation and Attribute.</b>&mdash;We have been
talking all this while about sensations, but we have not
yet said what sensations are. They make up, as you
will have guessed, one class of the mental elements, the
<i>elementary mental processes</i> of § 4, that we reach by
analysis of our complex experiences. They are therefore
simple and irreducible items of the mental world.
How shall we define them?</p>

<p>We can define them, in strictness, only by writing
down a complete list of what we have called their characters.
<i>Every sensation shows itself to us under various
aspects</i>, or, as we are accustomed to say, possesses a
number of <b>attributes</b>. We have been dealing, so far,
with the qualitative aspect of sensations. This may
itself be single; the quality of lights is just their lightness
or darkness; or it may be manifold; the quality
of colours can be properly described only if we take
account of hue, tint, and chroma; that of tones only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
if we take account of pitch, volume, and tonality, perhaps
also of vocality. <b>Quality</b> is the natural thing to
start out from, because it is what interests us most in
everyday life, and has therefore been named; so that,
when we speak of sensations, we speak of them by their
qualities. There are, however, several other attributes;
sensations possess <b>intensity</b>, and <b>vividness</b>, and <b>duration</b>,
and some of them possess <b>extension</b>. We shall discuss
these aspects later on.</p>

<p><i>Does it seem strange, now, that an elementary hit of
experience should turn so many sides to the observer?</i>
Think then of chemistry, and of the chemical elements.
Sodium is a chemical element; but it has many aspects
or properties; physically regarded, it is soft, it is fusible,
it volatilises at high temperatures; chemically, it combines
with oxygen, it decomposes water, it is univalent,
it has a low atomic weight, it is electropositive, and so
forth. Sodium cannot be reduced, chemically, to anything
simpler than itself, but it is nevertheless many-sided.
The same thing is true of sensations.</p>

<p>So a complete list of the aspects or attributes of sensation
is as near as we can come to a definition. But since
that sort of statement is clumsy; since we cannot make
it complete till we have observed the sensations under
all their possible aspects; and since we know that mental
processes are correlated with processes in the nervous
system; we may adopt another plan, and <i>define sensation
by reference to the special bodily organ with which it
is connected</i>. Sensations are then elementary mental
processes that come to us by way of skin, muscle, ear,
and the rest of the sense-organs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c67" id="c67">§ 16</a>. <b>The Intensity of Sensation.</b>&mdash;A sensation may
remain the same in quality, and yet vary in strength
or <b>intensity</b>. A pressure may be the pressure of an
ounce or of half-a-pound; it is always pressure, the
same quality, but its intensity differs. The tone you
get by blowing across the mouth of a bottle may be
loud or faint, though it is still the same pitch, the same
tone. The weight you carry may strain the arm very
little or a great deal; the sensation of strain from the
tendons is the same in both cases, but its intensity is
different.</p>

<p>The study of this attribute of sensations has led to
<i>the discovery of a psychological law</i>, which has much
practical importance. Suppose that we are working
with intensities of noise, the noise made by the drop of
an ivory ball upon an ebony block. Suppose that, by
varying the height from which the ball falls, we have
found a series of intensities of sensation <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, which
may be represented by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; a
series, that is, in which the difference between the two
noises <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> is equal in sensation to the difference between
<i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, or between <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, or between <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>.
That sounds a little difficult; but the series may really
be established without much trouble. Now, what about
the stimuli, the heights of fall? Must the ball drop
twice as far for <i>b</i> as for <i>a</i>, three times as far for <i>c</i> as for
<i>a</i>, and so on? No: <i>equal differences in intensity of
sensation do not correspond with equal differences in intensity
of stimulus. Equal differences in intensity of
sensation correspond rather with</i> <b>relatively</b> <i>equal difference
in the intensity of stimulus</i>. In other words,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p class="pi4 p1">the sensation-series 1 2 3 4 5 corresponds with<br />
a stimulus-series of the type 1 2 4 8 16;</p>

<p class="pn1">or, mathematically expressed, <i>an arithmetical series of
intensities of sensation is correlated with a geometrical
series of intensities of stimulus</i>. In the instance given,
the exponent of the geometrical series is 2; but that is
only an imaginary instance; in the case of <b>noise</b> the
actual exponent is 4/3, so that</p>

<p class="pi4 p1">the sensation-series 1  2    3    4      5 corresponds with<br />
the stimulus series  1 <span class="reduct"><sup>4</sup>/<sub>3</sub> <sup>16</sup>/<sub>9</sub> <sup>64</sup>/<sub>27</sub> <sup>256</sup>/<sub>81</sub></span>;</p>

<p class="p1">or, if we take units of some sort, such as millimetres of
height of fall,</p>

<p class="pi4 p1">the sensation-series 1   2   3   4   5 corresponds with<br />
the stimulus-series  81 108 144 192 256.</p>

<p class="p1">This law of correlation was first formulated by the
German physiologist E. H. Weber in 1834 as follows:
“in comparing objects and observing the distinction
between them, we perceive, not the difference between
the objects, but the ratio of this difference to the magnitude
of the objects compared.” Weber speaks of objects,
because he was thinking of experiments that he
had made with weights; he should have said sensations.
His law holds, over a middle range of intensities of sensation,
for <b>lights</b>, <b>sounds</b>, <b>pressures</b>, <b>various kinæsthetic
complexes</b>, and <b>odours</b>. Its validity in the fields of
taste and temperature is doubtful.</p>

<p>It is because of Weber’s law that we are able to ignore
the manifold changes of illumination to which we are
exposed in the course of the daylight hours; that the
painter, who cannot at all reproduce by his pigments
the absolute intensities of light in nature, can nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
give us a recognisably true copy of any natural
scene; and that a large block of seats in the concert-room,
at a moderate distance from the stage, can all be
sold at the same price and all have equal advantages
for hearing. You will readily find other instances of
its working, if you are clear as regards the principle involved;
namely, that the less you have of anything,
the less need be added, and the more you have, the more
must be added, to make an appreciable difference; or,
on the negative side, that you are not likely to notice
any difference in your surroundings, so long as the relations
of the stimuli remain unchanged. So Weber’s law
furnishes yet another reason for the apparent stability of
the landscape that we discussed on p. 63.</p>

<p class="p1">(1) Mark out, by indelible ink, a sq. cm. upon the outer
surface of the forearm. Make upon transparent paper
three maps of the area, marking hairs, veins, etc. Work
over the area (<i>a</i>) with the horsehair, for pressure spots;
(<i>b</i>) with a warmed carpenter’s spike, for warm spots;
and (<i>c</i>) with a cooled spike, for cold spots. Enter the spots,
as you find them, on the maps; remember to dot the hair
down for pressure, but to draw the spike slowly and evenly
along the skin for temperature. Lay the three maps together,
and note the distribution and the relative number of
the spots.</p>


<p>(2) After shampooing, the scalp is sensitive and irritable
under the brush. Why?</p>


<p>(3) When you are writing with a pencil, or prodding in a
pool with a stick, the sensations seem to come from the end
of the pencil or stick. What organs are involved? And
why should the sensations be localised as they are? Try
to think out some experimental means of attacking this
question.</p>


<p>(4) What sensations do you get in the act of yawning?
What in that of swallowing? What unusual sensations do
you have, from the face, after you have been running hard?</p>


<p>(5) How do sour and sweet in the mouth affect the sense
of touch? Make solutions, in varying strengths, of sugar and
of the juice of some very sour fruit; leave plenty of time between
observations.</p>


<p>(6) Prepare some bits of apple, onion, and raw potato.
Close your eyes and hold your nose; then pick up these
morsels at random, and chew them. Can you tell the difference?
How?</p>


<p>(7) Is there any evidence of taste contrast?</p>


<p>(8) Secure adaptation to the scent of camphor; breathe
regularly, and note the length of time necessary for the odour
to disappear. Now smell at vanilla, heliotrope, absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>

arguing by analogy from what you know of colours.</p>


<p>(9) The next time that you listen to an orchestra, pick out
the tones of the various instruments, and try to describe
their timbre; do not be afraid to string adjectives together,
but be sure that you hear what you put down. Later, look
up in a reference-book the composition of these various compound
tones, and see if there is any correlation between your
description and the number and loudness of the overtones.</p>


<p>(10) If you drop a block of wood on a desk, the sound is
simply noisy. If the same block forms part of a xylophone

How is this?</p>


<p>(11) When you next go to a reception, stand outside the
main rooms for a minute, and try to determine the pitch of

<p class="psh">Conceptions and apparitions [sensations and images] are nothing
really but motion in some internal substance of the head; which motion
not stopping there, but proceeding to the heart, of necessity must there
either help or hinder the motion which is called vital; when it helpeth, it
is called pleasure; but when such motion weakeneth or hindereth the
vital motion, then it is called pain.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thomas Hobbes</span></p>

<p>§ 17. <b>Simple Images.</b>&mdash;Common sense draws a sharp
distinction between our present perception of an object
or event, and our later revival of it in memory; and
psychologists have been accustomed, in the same way,
to distinguish the simple sensation, the elementary process
in perception, from the <b>simple image</b>, the elementary
process in memory. In fact, however, <i>it is very doubtful
if there is any real psychological difference between sensation
and image</i>. The statement is often made that the
image is weaker, fainter, more fleeting than the corresponding
sensation. Thus, the great philosopher David
Hume (1711-1776) wrote: “All the perceptions of the
human mind resolve themselves into two distinct kinds,
which I shall call <i>impressions</i> and <i>ideas</i>. [Hume’s terminology
is different from ours.] The difference between
these consists in the degrees of force and liveliness, with
which they strike upon the mind.” Hume himself
admits that “in sleep, in a fever, in madness, or in any
very violent emotions of soul, our ideas may approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to our impressions; as on the other hand it sometimes
happens that our impressions are so faint and low, that
we cannot distinguish them from our ideas.” It is
certain that sensation and image are often confused;
and some writers have accordingly proposed to drop the
term ‘image’ and to replace it by ‘secondary sensation.’
Let us look at the facts.</p>

<p>There is no department of sense in which sensation
stops entirely when its stimulus is removed; in all cases,
even in that of sound, the sensation is prolonged, for a
longer or shorter time, and either after an interval or
without interruption, in what is called the <b>positive after-image</b>.
Blow out a match in the dark, and wave the
glowing stem about; you see complete circles or figures
of eight; the sensation persists, although the stimulus
has passed from one part of the retina to another. In
some departments, the positive is followed by a <b>negative
after-image</b>; we have already mentioned the
antagonistic after-images of sight. So the removal of a
continued warm stimulus leaves a sensation of coolness;
and the swimming in the head that you feel while twirling
round is followed, when you come to rest, by a swimming
in the opposite direction. Lastly, the name of
<b>memory after-image</b> has been given to an experience
which is most familiar, perhaps, in the taking of dictation;
as you write the words last spoken, the speaker’s
voice still rings in your ears; the sound hangs for a few
seconds, as if arrested, and your pen is guided by the
mental echo. Similarly, an attentive glance at an object
may set up a sort of photographic image that remains
distinct for several seconds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>All the after-images are sensory in character. So too
are the <b>memory colours</b> that we habitually lay over
familiar objects (p. 63), and that make us see snow as
white and gold as yellow and coal as black, just because
they are ordinarily or typically white and yellow and
black. So also are the <b>recurrent images</b>, those troublesome
and haunting images to which most of us are subject
at times: the tunes that run in our head and that
we cannot get rid of, the rows of figures that obsess us
after a long morning of calculation, the bright disc that
keeps cropping up after we have spent several hours at
the microscope. So, again, are the images that serve
to complete and round out an imperfect perception. A
favourite device of modern advertising is to outline the
human figure only in part and to leave the remainder
to the imagination; and you will perhaps notice, if
you look attentively at such a figure, that the outline, so
far as the suggestion of the neighbouring lines is unambiguous,
is indeed completed in image, black on white or
colour on colour; only where the completion is uncertain
do the images fail. These <b>tied images</b>, so called
because they are unequivocally bound up with the sensory
portion of the perception, occur also in the sphere of
sound; a missing orchestral part, if it is familiar, may be
clearly heard by the conductor.</p>

<p><i>Not everyone has recurrent images; and perhaps only a
large minority have tied images.</i> The image&mdash;even if we
decide that it is only a secondary sensation, psychologically
indistinguishable from sensation&mdash;nevertheless
represents a later stage of biological development than
the sensation proper, and our equipment of images is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
correspondingly variable; your own experience may
be richly imaginal, while your friend, under the same
conditions, has hardly a trace of imagery. Those who
do possess recurrent and tied images agree that they are
distinguished from sensations rather by their context,
by the presence or absence of certain other processes,
than by any difference of nature. The same thing
holds of those abnormal phenomena to which Hume
referred. <b>Hallucinatory images</b> are by no means uncommon
in the drowsy period that precedes sleep; we
hear the telephone bell, or we hear our name called;
some of us&mdash;there are, again, great differences in individuals&mdash;have
hallucinations of sight. <b>Dream images</b>
also differ markedly from individual to individual; but
the dream is nearly always accepted as a real event.
One of the most puzzling facts in this connection is the
occurrence of concomitant or <b>synæsthetic images</b>. In
the commonest case, that of <b>coloured hearing</b>, any
auditory stimulus arouses, along with the appropriate
sensation of hearing, whether tone or noise, a visual
image of light or colour. The sound of the word
Tuesday, for instance, may be seen as a light grey-green
followed by a yellow! We might suppose, at first
thought, that coloured hearing is due to association, to
a connection between sight and hearing set up in childhood
and continued into adult life; but the evidence
points to some inborn connection in the nervous system;
coloured hearing tends strongly to run in families.
Moreover, we know of no natural or normal association
of colours with tones, although the attempt has often
been made to illustrate music by colours; the recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
colour-scoring of the Russian composer Scriabin is, for
instance, nothing more than an idiosyncrasy, and will
make no general or permanent appeal to the musical
public. There are many other kinds of synæsthesia,
besides this connection of sight and sound; and we have
no reason to think that every instance is to be explained
in just the same way; in all cases, however, we have a
particular sensation uniformly accompanied by another,
which we may call either a secondary sensation or an
image of sensory character.</p>

<p>Coming back to the normal life, we have next to note
the part played in certain minds by <b>habitual images</b>.
Just as, in Wagner’s operas, the performer comes upon
the stage to the accompaniment of some characteristic
musical phrase, some ‘motive,’ as it is called, which
recurs again and again as he enters and reenters to take
his share of the action, so in minds of the imaginal type
such general notions as ‘virtue’ and ‘commerce’ and
‘summer’ may regularly call up mental pictures, little
groups of images, which illustrate or characterise the
notions: thus, virtue may be pictured mentally by
the flash of a human figure, standing very upright.
These pictures are usually incomplete, mere impressionist
sketches; but they may remain unchanged for years.</p>

<p>Finally, we come to the images which enter into our
ideas of memory and of imagination. We discuss these
ideas later; here we need only say that the psychological
distinction between sensation and image, if it is to be
drawn at all, must be drawn between sensation and the
<b>free images of memory and imagination</b>, and cannot be
drawn earlier. Some psychologists believe that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
memory-image can always be distinguished from a sensation,
that the two processes differ in their intrinsic
nature. It is difficult to put the question to the test
of experiment; but what evidence we have seems to
look the other way. We shall do best to suspend judgement.</p>

<p>The word ‘image’ is unfortunately used, as the foregoing
paragraphs have shown, both for the simple image
and for groups or clusters of images; thus, the recurrent
image and the habitual image are always complex.
Summing up our results, with this warning in mind, we
may say that positive and negative after-images, memory
colours, and synæsthetic images are definitely sensory
in character; that the simple images which make
up memory after-images, recurrent and tied and habitual
images, hallucinations and dreams, appear to be of the
same kind; and that the simple images which compose
our ideas of memory and imagination may or may not
be intrinsically different from sensations. The simple
image may therefore be defined as <i>an elementary mental
process, akin to sensation and perhaps indistinguishable
from it, which persists when the sensory stimulus is withdrawn
or appears when the sensory stimulus is absent</i>. We
may say further that, while every normal person has
very much the same equipment of sensations, there are
great individual differences in the matter of secondary
sensations or images; in some cases they are interwoven
into the whole tissue of experience, in others they are
infrequent or even lacking; we shall see presently
how they may be replaced. In general, images of sight
and sound are common; then come images of touch and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
temperature, and then again images of taste and smell,
which are uncommon; organic images are very rare.
Kinæsthetic images undoubtedly occur, and probably
occur frequently; but they are likely to blend with
kinæsthetic sensations, and so to escape notice.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c79" id="c79">§ 18</a>. <b>Simple Feelings and Sense-Feelings.</b>&mdash;Many
of our experiences are indifferent; but many of them,
again, are pleasant or unpleasant. These two words,
<i>pleasant</i> and <i>unpleasant</i>, denote elementary mental
processes of a different sort from sensations and images;
they are known as <b>simple feelings</b>. The term ‘feeling’
is itself even more ambiguous than the term ‘image’;
it is natural to speak of ‘feeling’ a strain or effort, a
warmth or cold; but we shall henceforth use it only
in its technical meaning, to indicate the way in which
stimuli affect us, pleasantly or unpleasantly. We must
discard altogether the words <i>pleasure</i> and <i>pain</i>, although
they have long been current as the names of the simple
feelings, and although they are much less clumsy than
pleasant and unpleasant. We discard them because
pain is a sensation (p. 43); and pains, while usually
unpleasant, may at times be pleasant; the scratching
that relieves an itch and the nip of the wind on a brisk
winter’s day are both pains, but they are also both
pleasant.</p>

<p><i>The main difference between sensation and simple
feeling is that a feeling cannot be made the object of direct
attention.</i> Try to attend to the pleasantness or unpleasantness
of an experience, and the feeling evaporates,
eludes you; it is like clutching a ghost; you find yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
beyond the feeling, so to speak, and face to face
with some obtrusive sensation or image that you had
no wish to meet. This peculiarity of feeling must, of
course, be taken account of in our conduct of the psychological
method of observation. The formula of
observation (p. 19) was:</p>

<p class="pc1">psychological (vivid experience → full report).</p>

<p class="p1">In the case of sensation, the observer is set or disposed,
beforehand, to attend to sensation and to report upon
sensation; the sensation comes, and is attended to;
and the report which follows is determined, under the
influence of the preliminary set or disposition, by the
nature of the sensation. In the case of feeling, the observer
is set to attend to sensation, but to report upon
the feeling which accompanies the sensation; the sensation
comes and is attended to; and the report then
describes, under the influence of the preliminary set,
the feeling which accompanied the sensation. That
sounds a little paradoxical; but the method is not difficult
in practice; and it has the advantage that we can
use all manner of sensory stimuli (colours, tones, everything)
in our study of feeling.</p>

<p>We find, first of all, that <i>pleasant and unpleasant are
really opposites</i>; the colour or tone that is most often reported
as pleasant is least often reported as unpleasant,
and conversely. An obvious result? Not at all; for
what is obvious to common sense demands very careful
consideration at the hands of science; and the fact
that, in this instance, common sense turns out to be
right does not at all mean that we should have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
justified in taking it for granted. We find, secondly,
that <i>intensity of feeling behaves like intensity of sensation</i>
(p. 67); the more pleasant or unpleasant an experience
is, the more must the stimulus be changed if we are
to feel a difference; and the less pleasant or unpleasant
it is, the less change need be made to produce a change of
feeling.</p>

<p><i>There is no convincing evidence of any qualities of feeling
other than pleasant and unpleasant.</i> There is evidence,
on the other hand, that the simple feelings form intimate
and characteristic blends with sensations, and especially
with kinæsthetic and organic sensations; we may call
such blends <b>sense-feelings</b>. Every sensory stimulus,
even so local and trifling a thing as a tone of moderate
intensity, sets up a widespread organic disturbance:
a result that is natural, perhaps, in view of the manifold
interconnections within the nervous system, but that
we are nevertheless likely to overlook. This organic
stir brings out kinæsthetic and organic sensations which
may form the body of a sense-feeling, developed round
about the disturbing tone, and giving it a peculiar tinge
of feeling that it would not otherwise possess. The same
thing holds of other stimuli. We can distinguish <i>six
types or classes of these sense-feelings: the agreeable and
disagreeable, the exciting and subduing, and the straining
and relaxing</i>. Tastes and smells are preeminently agreeable
or disagreeable. Deep tones are solemn and serious,
that is, subduing; high tones are cheerful and playful,
that is, exciting. The painter’s ‘warm’ colours, red
and yellow, are exciting; his ‘cold’ blues are subduing;
the gloom of a darkened room is positively depressing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Warmth and cold are themselves exciting and subduing.
The straining and relaxing feelings are dependent upon
the temporal course and succession of sensations; the
interminable pedal-point in <i>E</i>♭ with which Wagner
begins the <i>Ring</i> sets up a feeling of tension which is relaxed
when the <i>B</i>♭ is added, only to grow again, and
again relax when new tones are introduced; and if you
follow the strokes of a slow-beating metronome you get
a similar alternation of the two sense-feelings. Notice
that the six names are all alike class-names; <i>the sense-feelings
themselves appear in numberless variety</i>; but any
particular sense-feeling may be referred to one or more
of the classes. Notice also that the paired names are
all opposites: a sense-feeling may be agreeably exciting,
or agreeably subduing, but it cannot be excitingly subduing;
and so on with the rest. Remember finally
that the simple feeling taken alone, and not blended
with sensory qualities into a sense-feeling, is always a
bare pleasant or unpleasant.</p>

<p>We must next discuss <i>the organic disturbances that accompany
feeling itself</i>. We know that feelings ‘express’
themselves in various ways; we blush for shame and
pale from fear; we shake with rage, and our ‘heart
beats high’ with hope. Now it is possible to measure
all these organic changes; to record the rate and height
of pulse, for instance, or the variation in the volume of
a limb according as blood flows into it or is withdrawn
from it; physiology puts the necessary instruments at
our disposal. The observer may therefore be harnessed
to some such system of recording apparatus, and may be
subjected to some pleasant or unpleasant stimulus; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
reports what he feels, and the experimenter is able to
compare the report with the record from the instrument.
The results of work of this sort are summed up in the
following table; where a + stands for an increase, and
a-for a decrease, of rate or height or volume, as the
case may be.</p>

<table id="t02" summary="t02">

 <tr>
  <td> </td>
  <td class="tdc2"><span class="smcap">Pleasant</span></td>
  <td class="tdc2"><span class="smcap">Unpleasant</span></td>

  <td class="tdl3">?<span class="vh">&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>+</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="pn1">The table asserts that, during a pleasant experience,
our pulse is slowed and heightened; blood flows from
the trunk into the extremities; and our breathing quickens
and, perhaps, grows more shallow. During an unpleasant
experience, the reverse of all these things takes
place.</p>

<p>The pleasant and unpleasant experiences here referred
to are, of course, agreeable and disagreeable sense-feelings;
and we have the right to correlate the organic
changes with pleasant and unpleasant feeling only
because they remain the same so long as feeling remains
the same, whatever may be the character of the sensory
stimulus. There can be no doubt that similar tables
may presently be made out for the other sense-feelings;
indeed, that must be the case, in so far as the sense-feelings
are stable blends of simple feeling with sensations.
But it is not easy, in the case of the other pairs,
to secure a stable blend, to keep the nature of the ‘excitement’
or the ‘relaxation’ just the same from experiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to experiment; and we shall therefore make no
attempt here to list their bodily expressions. We come
back to the general subject of expression when we deal
with emotion (§ 51).</p>

<p>Can we now say anything definite about <i>the nervous
correlate of the simple feelings</i>? Can we say what is
going on in the nervous system when we feel pleasantly
or unpleasantly? Unfortunately no: <i>we have many
theories, but no positive knowledge</i>. There is, however,
one view of feeling which has persisted from Aristotle
to the present day; and we must say a word about it,
if only because you cannot read far in psychology without
running against some form of it, and you should
not blindly accept it. We may call it the <b>biological
theory</b> of feeling. Aristotle said that pleasure (we must
now use the old-fashioned terms) accompanies the unimpeded
exercise of any faculty, that is, the healthy
exercise of any mental faculty upon its appropriate
object; and that pain accompanies impeded activity.
In more modern language, pleasure is for Aristotle a
matter of efficiency. Herbert Spencer puts the same
idea into evolutionary language; “pains are the correlatives
of actions injurious to the organism, while pleasures
are the correlatives of actions conducive to its
welfare.” Does this statement really mean, though,
that a man’s personal pleasures are always good for him
and his personal pains bad for him?&mdash;because, if that
is meant, it is not difficult to think of any number of
cases to the contrary. No, not quite that; Spencer
would qualify by saying that nature can only strike an
average for the species; she cannot attend in detail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to the individual; the sentence means that on the whole,
in the long run, pleasures are good and pains are bad
for us. We might reply that it is rather a poor average
that makes the tearing off of a finger nail so exquisitely
painful, though the loss hardly matters, and that allows
the ravages of pulmonary tuberculosis to run so
long a course before warning is given to the suffering
organism. But let us offer a definite objection: a surgical
operation is not pleasant; yet it may be the one
thing necessary to save life. Spencer has his answer:
“special and proximate pleasures and pains must be
disregarded out of consideration for remote and diffused
pleasures and pains.” In that case, however,&mdash;if the
feelings are merely witnesses to the state of affairs at
the moment, and not prophets of the future,&mdash;the
correlation does not help us very much; nature’s achievement
is less important, even for the species, than it
seemed at first. Or take another objection: I am overheated,
and I sit in a cooling draught; the result is
catarrh or pneumonia; yet the coolness was pleasant.
To be sure, says the biologist; and the local effect was
good for you; the testimony of the feelings is limited
in space as I have just acknowledged it to be limited
in time. Again, however, we must rejoin that, in that
event, the correlation is of less importance to the race
than it was asserted to be; if things that are ‘sweet
in the mouth’ are going to be ‘bitter in the belly’ we
want to know it; it is small comfort to be told that the
organ of taste is benefited by the pleasant sweetness.
And so the argument might go on.</p>

<p>There is yet another difficulty. “Every pleasure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>”
says Spencer, “increases vitality; every pain decreases
vitality. Every pleasure raises the tide of life; every
pain lowers the tide of life.” Yet we read elsewhere
that “pleasures are the incentives to life-supporting
acts, and pains the deterrents from life-destroying acts.”
Pain, then, is thoroughly bad for us, because it is detrimental
to life; but pain at the same time is thoroughly
good for us, because it prevents our doing what is detrimental
to life. Pain as detrimental ought to have been
eliminated by natural selection; pain as warning of what
is detrimental has been conserved by natural selection.
Can the two points of view be reconciled?</p>

<p><i>It would be foolish and overhasty to reject outright the
biological view of feeling</i>; the very fact that it has lasted
through so many centuries and, in some form or other,
has appealed to so many psychologists&mdash;the quotation
which heads this chapter is a case in point!&mdash;raises
a presumption in its favour. Our conclusion must
rather be this: that general formulas, which need to be
qualified almost as soon as they are phrased, and which
lay themselves open to all kinds of specific objections,
cannot help us to a psychology of feeling&mdash;or of anything
else. When we have found out, by detailed experimental
work, what the nervous correlate of simple
feeling really is, then we may perhaps advance to some
general biological view; but the detailed work must
come first.</p>

<p class="pc2"><b><a name="c87" id="c87"></a>Questions and Exercises</b></p>

<p class="p1">(1) Answer the questions printed on pp. 255, 256 of F.
Galton’s <i>Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development</i>
(Everyman’s Library, E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., New York;
price 35 cents). When you have answered them, read
Galton’s discussion of mental imagery, pp. 57 ff. (You will
find many other interesting things in the book; for instance,
the discussion of synæsthesia, pp. 105 ff.)</p>


<p>(2) Try to secure a memory after-image, (<i>a</i>) by glancing
attentively at a lamplit study-table, and then closing the
eyes; and (<i>b</i>) by listening attentively to a short musical
phrase or to a dictated sentence. How do you distinguish
this image from a positive after-image?</p>


<p>(3) Describe the tied images that you find in the following
figure.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-087.jpg" width="500" height="81"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>(4) How is it that very great differences in mental imagery
may go undetected in everyday life?</p>


<p>(5) Try to give instances, from your own experience,
(<i>a</i>) of the confusion of sensation and image, (<i>b</i>) of memory-colours,
and (<i>c</i>) of the alteration of a perception by an
image-complex. (An instance under (<i>c</i>) would be, for example,
your failure to find something that you had lost,
although it lay in plain sight, because you had a mental
picture of it, different from its actual look in perception.)</p>


<p>(6) The following have been given, by various psychologists,
as differences between sensation and simple feeling.
What have you to say about them? (<i>a</i>) Sensation depends
upon a present stimulus; feeling depends not only upon
stimulus, but upon the whole state of the individual at the
moment. (<i>b</i>) Sensations range between maximal differences;
feelings between maximal opposites. (<i>c</i>) All sensations have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
corresponding images; there is no image of pleasantness or
unpleasantness. (<i>d</i>) Sensations may be localised; feelings
are not localisable.</p>


<p>(7) Professor Wundt, who first distinguished the groups
of agreeable and disagreeable, exciting and subduing, straining
and relaxing feelings, thinks that these experiences are
not sense-feelings, but are all simple feelings; so that there
are three dimensions of simple feeling, the pleasant-unpleasant,
the exciting-subduing, and the straining-relaxing, corresponding
in a way with the three dimensions of space. What
criticism have you to offer? And how would you test
Wundt’s theory?</p>


<p>(8) Do you think that a mixed feeling, a feeling which is
at the same moment pleasant and unpleasant, is a possible
experience? Give your reasons, and support them by observations.
Can you remember any references, that bear
on the question, in poetry or fiction?</p>


<p>(9) Analyse the sense-feelings of smarting pain, of health,
of hunger, of oppressive heat.</p>


<p>(10) Can you give, from your own experience, any evidence
for the belief that Weber’s law holds for intensity of feeling?</p>


<p>(11) The chapter teaches that the pleasantness of a perfume,
of a word of praise, and of a kindly action is, as simple
feeling, identical; there are no qualitative differences in
the pleasant. To many persons this teaching is repugnant.
Why? and how should their objections be answered?</p>


<p>(12) Define (without looking at the book!) sensation,
simple image, simple feeling.</p>

<p>§19. <b>The Problem of Attention.</b>&mdash;We have now
finished our survey of the elementary processes of mind;
<i>all our complex experiences may be analysed into sensations,
simple images, and simple feelings</i>. There has
been no special difficulty, so far, in exchanging the common-sense
point of view for that of scientific psychology.
You may not have realised, positively and intimately,
that sensations and simple images are all meaningless;
that we have described them simply as processes, as
experiences going on; you may have been surprised,
in view of the everyday distinction of perception from
memory and imagination, to find that the simple image
is only doubtfully to be distinguished from the sensation;
and you may also have been surprised to learn
that the feelings owe their manifold variety of tang and
tincture to the sensations with which a simple feeling,
pleasant or unpleasant, is blended. There is, however,
no real difficulty, when once these things are pointed
out, in taking up a scientific standpoint towards the
mental elements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as we pass to consider <i>attention</i>, the case is
changed; we come into definite conflict with popular
psychology. <b>Common sense regards attention as a
voluntary concentration of the mind.</b> For instance:
I am sitting at my desk, thinking out and writing down
the sentences of this paragraph. As I write, I am subject
to all sorts of sensory stimuli; the temperature of
the room, the pressure of my clothes, the sight of various
pieces of furniture, the sounds from house and street,
the scents coming from the room itself or borne in through
the open window, organic excitations of various kinds.
I could easily let my mind wander; I could lapse into
reminiscence, or give the rein to my imagination. Yet
I am perfectly well able to ignore all these distractions,
and to concentrate upon my self-imposed task. Surely,
says common sense, surely the whole situation implies
a selective and spontaneous mental activity; I give
my attention, of my own accord, to a certain topic that I
have myself chosen; I could, if I liked, attend to something
wholly different. That is <i>the nature of attention
as it is viewed by common sense</i>.</p>

<p>Let us see, however, how things look when we try
to <b>describe</b> attention, without making any effort to
interpret or explain it. Suppose that, as I sit writing
this paragraph, I am called to the telephone, or am interrupted
by the entrance of a friend. My attention
is thus diverted to a new object. What happens?
Something happens that we can only describe as <b>a shift
of the vividness of our mental processes</b>. A moment
ago, my psychological ideas were vivid, set (as it were)
in the focus of attention, while all other ideas and perceptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
were dim and marginal; now the incoming
ideas&mdash;my friend’s business or the subject of the message&mdash;drive
to the front; they in their turn become
vivid and focal, while the psychological ideas, just
lately central and dominant, fall back, along with the
perception of my sensory surroundings, into the dim
background. <i>Attention, therefore, if we consider it
purely descriptively, hinges not upon mental activity, but
upon the vividness of mental processes</i>; and the state of
attention may be described as a certain pattern or arrangement
of mental processes; whenever our experience
shows the pattern of vivid centre and dim background,
of bright focus and obscure margin, then we have
attention before us.</p>

<p>What, then, is <b>vividness</b>? The answer has been
given already (p. 66): vividness is <i>one of the universal
aspects or attributes of sensation</i>. Just as all sensations
vary in intensity, so do all sensations vary in vividness.
If you want a more positive answer; if you want to
know how precisely vividness ‘feels’ in experience;
observe your mental processes now, as you are puzzling
over this book; the difference between foreground and
background, focus and margin,&mdash;between the dominant
ideas aroused by what you read, and the obscure perceptions
derived from your surroundings,&mdash;will show
itself at any rate in the rough. <i>Be careful not to confuse
vividness with intensity</i>: when you are listening
intently for a very faint sound, the sound, as it comes,
is the most vivid experience you have, although it is
near the lower limit of intensity; and when you are absorbed
in your work, the sound of the dinner-gong in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
hall may be very dim and obscure, although it is loud
enough to be heard all over the house. <i>Be careful, too,
not to confuse sensory vividness with definiteness of meaning</i>
(p. 29). A patch of colour in an oil-painting may
strongly attract your attention, may thus be extremely
vivid, and may yet be altogether unintelligible; and
another patch of colour, that you have passed over with
‘half a glance’ and that remains permanently in the
background of experience, may carry the perfectly
definite meaning of a dead soldier. Differences of
vividness are neither differences of strong and weak in
sensation, nor of distinct and indistinct in understanding;
they are more like differences of robust and weakly, or
of self-assertive and retiring.</p>

<p>These preliminary remarks are, perhaps, enough to show
the nature of <i>the problem that attention sets to a scientific
psychology</i>. We shall be concerned with sensory vividness;
we have to find out under what circumstances
a sensation or image becomes vivid, and under what
circumstances it becomes obscure; we have to trace
the pattern of attention in greater detail and with more
accuracy; we have to ask how many sensations may
be vivid at the same time, and how long they remain
vivid; and so on. We must keep the common-sense
view always in mind, so that the scientific alternative
stands out clearly and distinctly against it; and we must
take scientific account of all that common sense lays
down.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c93" id="c93">§ 20</a>. <b>The Development of Attention.</b>&mdash;If we consider
a large number of cases of attention, we find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
they fall into three great groups; and each one of these
groups seems to represent a stage in the development of
mind at large, a level of mental evolution. We speak
accordingly of <b>primary</b>, of <b>secondary</b>, and of <b>derived
primary attention</b>. Let us consider them in order.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Primary attention.</i>&mdash;There are certain classes
of stimuli that force attention upon us; they take us by
storm, and we can offer no resistance; when they appear,
we must attend, whatever our preoccupation may be.
<i>Intensive</i> stimuli belong to this class: very loud sounds,
very bright lights, strong tastes and smells, severe pressures,
extreme temperatures, intense pains, one and all
take possession of us, dominate us in their own right.
A stimulus that is often <i>repeated</i> is also likely to attract
the attention, even if at first it went unremarked. <i>Sudden</i>
stimuli, and sudden changes of stimulus, have the
same effect. So with <i>movement</i>: the animal or bird
that crosses the landscape, the melody that rises and
falls to a steady accompaniment, the insect that crawls
over our hand as we lie on the grass, all alike constrain
our attention. A <i>novel</i> stimulus has the same
power; it stands alone and unrelated; it startles or
arrests us.</p>

<p>Here then is a fairly long list&mdash;high intensity, repetition,
suddenness, movement, novelty&mdash;of controls
to which the human organism is subject. Let any one
of them come into play, and <i>the corresponding sensation
is made vivid</i>, shoots to the focus, engrosses us. We may
very quickly shake off the control, and return to the
business that it interrupted; but we cannot altogether
escape it. The irresistible appeal of these various modes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of stimulation shows us attention at its first developmental
level.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Secondary attention.</i>&mdash;This casual and forced
attention is not, however, what we ordinarily mean
when we speak of ‘giving attention’ to something. We
mean rather the sustained attention that we pay to a
task, a lecture, a puzzle; we often mean an attention
that goes against the grain, in which <i>we</i> seem to do the
forcing, holding our mind by main force upon a tedious
and uninteresting subject. Is not this secondary attention
very different from primary attention? Let us see.</p>

<p>If you think how many sense-organs man has, all of
them open to manifold stimulation at the same time;
and if you think, further, how many different lines of
interest man has, all of them likely to bring up ideas of
memory or ideas of imagination; you will realise that
only very powerful stimuli, those that make an unescapeable
biological appeal to the organism, can compel attention&mdash;that
is, can thrust their sensations to the focus&mdash;as
if in disregard of competition. Such stimuli are <i>hors
de concours</i>; all the rest have to face their rivals. This
fact gives us the answer to our question. Secondary
attention is in reality nothing else than <i>a conflict of
nerve-forces, each one of which, if it were acting alone,
would make its sensation or image the most vivid bit of
experience at the moment, but each one of which is continually
checked and thwarted by other forces that are urging
their own sensations or images to the front</i>. We might
say, in brief, that secondary attention is a conflict of
two or more primary attentions; but we must remember
that the actual fighting is done in the nervous system;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
we shall say more of that presently. We can observe
some part of this struggle; our mind wanders, our eye
is caught by some chance movement and we lose the
thread of our work, we surprise ourselves thinking of
something else, we look at our watch to see how the hour
is going; in a word, the focal processes are instable;
now one and now another perception or idea becomes
more vivid than the rest; and the continual shift of
vividness is proof of the conflict of the underlying nerve-forces.</p>

<p>And the outcome? The outcome is that <i>the stronger
side always wins</i>. Not necessarily the stronger side as
we observe it; there may be a more impressive array
of ideas on the side that finally gives way; but the side
that has the stronger nerve-forces. It is quite certain
that <i>nervous forces or tendencies</i>&mdash;think of the force of
habit!&mdash;<i>may guide and direct the course of our thoughts,
even though they do not themselves contribute to thought</i>,
even though (that is) they have no sensory or imaginal
correlates. We shall have more to say of these guiding
tendencies later; meantime let us give an illustration
of their power. Suppose that an observer comes into
the laboratory to take part in a certain experiment, and
that the experimenter carefully explains to him what
he is to do. The next day he comes again, and the explanation
is repeated. The next day he comes again;
this time the experimenter says nothing; the experiment
just goes on in the usual way; and so on the following
days. Suppose, however, that on the twentieth
day the experimenter says: ‘Are you thinking about
what I told you to do?’ The observer, fearing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
he has done wrong, and feeling very repentant, says:
‘No! to tell the truth I had forgotten all about it; it
had absolutely gone out of my mind; have I been making
mistakes?’ He had not made any mistake; but his
reply shows that a certain tendency, impressed upon his
nervous system by the experimenter’s original explanation,
had been effective to direct his ideas long after
the idea of the explanation itself had disappeared.
And what happens here, in a few days’ work in the laboratory,
is happening every day of our lives in the wider
experience outside of the laboratory.</p>

<p>We see, therefore, that there is nothing spontaneous
or active about secondary attention. It is merely
primary attention over again, but <i>primary attention
under difficulties</i>; it is a direct consequence of the multiplication
of perceptions and ideas, and of the complexity
of the nervous system.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Derived primary attention.</i>&mdash;One of the strongest
proofs that there is no real difference between primary
and secondary attention is that, in course of time, these
difficulties vanish. Habit, as we say, becomes second
nature; the thoughts that at first moved haltingly and
with all sorts of interruption gradually become absorbing;
work that was once done with pains and labour
grows fascinating, and makes an unquestioned demand
upon us. So the period of struggle ends, and <i>we slip
back again into primary attention; only this derived form
is controlled, not by the great biological stimuli, but by
impressions that fit in with our acquired interests</i>. The
collector, the inventor, the expert are roused to keen attention
by stimuli which the rest of the world pass without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
special notice. Most of the striking coincidences of
life are accounted for by this law; you are thinking
about certain things, and something happens that,
because you are thus thinking and because it is akin
to the subject of your thought, captures your attention.
‘What an amazing coincidence!’ you cry; but if you
had been occupied with some other topic, there would
have been no coincidence. The man in Mr. Kipling’s
story who wondered, years after the event, ‘how in the
world he could have written such good stuff as that’, had
written under this same law of attention; for when you
are thoroughly absorbed in a subject, relevant facts
and ideas crowd upon you; the mind stands open to
them, while it is fast locked against the irrelevant; and
you surpass yourself. There is, to be sure, another side
to the picture; the enthusiastic adoption of a belief
or theory throws into brilliant relief all the facts that
tell in its favour, but blinds you to the considerations
that make against it.</p>

<p>In sum, then, <b>attention appears in the human mind
at three stages of development</b>: as primary attention,
determined by any stimulus that is biologically powerful;
as secondary attention, during which a perception or
idea dominates the mind in face of opposition; and as
derived primary attention, when this perception or idea
has gained practically undisputed ascendency over its
rivals. Looking at life in the large, we may say that
the period of training or education is a period of secondary
attention, and that the following period of mastery
and achievement is a period of derived primary attention.
Looking at experience more in detail, we see that education<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
itself consists, psychologically, in an alternation
of the two attentions; habit is made the basis of further
acquisition, and acquisition, gained with effort, passes
in its turn into habit; the cycle recurs, so long as the
nervous system remains plastic. Secondary attention
thus appears as a stage of transition, of conflict, of waste
of nervous energy, though it appears also as the necessary
preliminary to a stage of real knowledge. Meanwhile
and all the while there is no escape from interruption
by the original primary attention; but the interruptions
grow less and less disturbing as civilisation proceeds.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c99" id="c99">§ 21</a>. <b>The Nature of Attention.</b>&mdash;Our next task, in
the words of p. 93, is to <i>trace the pattern of attention</i>, to
describe as accurately as possible the arrangement of
our vivid and obscure sensations. Notice that, in
popular parlance, attention covers only the vivid processes
of the moment; psychologically, however, the
term includes both the vivid and the obscure, those that
we are ‘distracted from’ as well as those that we are
‘attending to,’ This being understood, we may attempt
a description.</p>

<p>It seems that, <i>in most cases, the state of attention is</i>
<b>twofold</b> <i>and only twofold</i>. There is a cluster of sensations
at the centre, all of approximately the same vividness,
and there is a mass of sensations in the background,
all of approximately the same obscurity. Suppose that
you are looking at one of the puzzle-pictures that are
published in certain magazines,&mdash;trying to find a face
outlined in the branches of a tree. At first, the whole
picture is vivid, and the rest of your experience is obscure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Suddenly you find what you are seeking; and what
happens? In all likelihood, the picture drops with a
jerk into the general dimness of the background, while
the face that you have discovered stands out by itself
in all imaginable vividness; you forget the picture, and
see nothing but the face. The state of attention, then,
in this its usual form, may be represented by two concentric
circles; a small inner circle stands for the focus
of attention, a large outer circle circumscribes its margin.
There is experimental evidence that, when our
sensations are thus arranged, their vividness and obscurity
are, as the arithmetics say, inversely proportional;
<i>the more vivid the central processes, the more obscure are
the marginal</i>; or, in untechnical language, the more we
are concentrated upon any one thing, the less liable are
we to distraction by other things. This twofold arrangement
seems to be, for most of us, the regular pattern
of attention; but certain observations in the laboratory,
which are borne out by statements in various text-books
of psychology, make it practically certain that <i>there is
another, less frequent and more complicated type of arrangement</i>.
Here the picture does not drop clear down into
the background, when the face is found, but remains
poised somewhere between focal vividness and marginal
obscurity; so that three degrees of vividness&mdash;sometimes
even four have been reported&mdash;may be distinguished
in one and the same state of attention. In
such cases, attention must be represented by three or
four concentric circles; the inner and the outer still show
the focus and margin of the total state; the others indicate
that there are sensations present whose vividness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
lies somewhere between those extremes. Whether the
focal processes suffer from the rivalry of the moderately
vivid sensations; whether, that is, attention in its threefold
or fourfold pattern is necessarily, even at the best,
of a lower degree than the best attention of the twofold
kind, we do not know.</p>

<p>Our description of attention is so far complete; but
there are two further questions that naturally occur.
Do we not attend to what ‘interests’ us? In that
case, however, attention must imply feeling. And is
not sustained attention tiring? In that case, attention
would seem to imply muscular sensation. These are
undoubtedly points to be considered, and we must try
to get at the facts. <i>Are feeling and kinæsthesis necessary
in attention</i>, or are they merely chance accompaniments
of the attentive state?</p>

<p>It all depends upon the stage of development at which
attention appears. At first, in <b>primary attention</b>, the
organism <i>perceived</i> the strong or sudden or novel or moving
thing, as sight or sound or touch, and also <i>felt</i> it,
as disturbing or startling or surprising; attention implied
a sense-feeling. At the same time, the organism <i>took
up an attitude</i> to the stimulus, in the literal sense; faced
it, as peering and listening and frightened animals face
such stimuli to-day. At this stage, then, <i>the shift of
vividness is always accompanied both by feeling and by
sensations</i>,&mdash;sensations due to internal bodily changes
and to muscular attitude. Then comes <b>secondary
attention</b>, with its conflict between various claimants
for the inner circle of attention; and the conflicting
stimuli will, naturally, arouse a medley of sense-feelings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and set up a struggle of more or less incompatible motor
attitudes. In civilised man, the scene of the conflict has
been largely transferred from perception to idea; but
<i>the effort that we make when we apply ourselves to a task,
the difficulty that we have in settling down, the fatigue that
results from sustained work upon a difficult theme</i>, all
these things are reminders of the general uneasiness and
restlessness that characterise secondary attention at the
perceptive level. Only when we come to <b>derived primary
attention</b> do feeling and kinæsthesis cease to be
necessary factors in the attentive state. What we call
mechanical, habitual, expert, professional attention
means extremely vivid experience; but it <i>need not involve
either feeling or kinæsthetic sensation</i>. Attention is
no longer turbid with organic processes; the stream
of mind has cleared itself. Common sense would say,
and rightly, that a cool and critical poise has replaced
the older animal excitement, and would emphasize the
value of this change. We do not question the value;
but we are at the end of our psychological enquiry when
we have shown what the change in experience actually
is, and how it is brought about.</p>

<p>But are we at the end? Should we not say something
about <b>inattention</b>, which in everyday life we take to be
the opposite of attention? have we not still to describe
the inattentive state? No: <i>in the normal waking life
there is, in strictness, no such thing as inattention</i>. We
give that name to an attention which is directed upon
what we regard as an improper object. The inattentive
person is merely attending to something else; the pattern
remains the same. It is possible that, in certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
abnormal cases, all mental processes alike run their
course in relative obscurity; but even here we are not
dealing with inattention; there is some weakness or
obstruction of nerve-forces, which prevents sensations
from reaching their full normal vividness.</p>


<p class="p2"><a name="c103" id="c103">§ 22</a>. <b>The Experimental Study of Attention.</b>&mdash;The
question of the <b>range</b> of attention,&mdash;how many sensations
or images may occupy the focus at the same time,&mdash;was
canvassed in the Middle Ages: witness our
quotation from St. Thomas. The first appeal to experiment
seems to have been made, in the late thirties of the
past century, by the Scottish philosopher Sir Wm. Hamilton.
“You can easily make the experiment for yourselves,”
Hamilton tells his students, “but you must
beware of grouping the objects into classes. If you
throw a handful of marbles on the floor, you will find it
difficult to view at once more than six, or seven at most,
without confusion; but if you group them into twos, or
threes, or fives, you can comprehend as many groups
as you can units.” The experiment is not very rigorous;
but more accurate work on the subject shows that
Hamilton was not far wrong. <i>If a field of simple visual
stimuli is shown for a brief time, the practised observer
is in fact able to grasp six of them</i>; and if familiar groups
are substituted for the separate stimuli (short words for
letters, or playing-card fives for single dots), the range
of visual attention remains the same.</p>

<p><i>In this case the stimuli are presented together in space;
they may also be presented in time.</i> If you listen to a
metronome beating, say, 15 in the minute, you will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
able with practice to hold <i>six successive strokes</i> in the
focus of attention, but not more; if you try to group
the seventh stroke with the preceding six you become
confused; the series breaks, and cannot be welded together
again. As the speed of the metronome is increased,
the beats fall of themselves into groups of twos
and threes; and you can still grasp and hold six of these
rhythmical impressions. When the speed has reached
some 200 in the minute, the rhythmical grouping becomes
more complicated; as many as eight single beats
may be bound together in a rhythmical unit; and the
attention is adequate, again after practice, to five of
these complex groups; the focus comprises no less than
forty separate strokes of the pendulum. <i>This result,
we may note, agrees very well with the canons of musical
and poetic composition.</i> The musical phrase never contains
more than six measures, and the poetical line or verse
never contains more than six feet; a seven-measured
phrase or a seven-footed line falls to pieces, ceases to be
unitary. The rhythmical wholes of a higher order, the
period in music and the stanza or strophe in poetry,
never contain more than five phrases or verses; as a
rule, neither contains more than four.</p>

<p>So much for range; we turn to consider <b>duration</b>;
how long can a sensation maintain itself at the focus?
how long can we attend to a single simple impression?
The early experiments on this question were most ingenious.
The observer was required to look steadily
at a little disc of very light grey, shown against a white
background, or to listen intently to the very faint sound
of a stream of fine sand; and the theory was that, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
these stimuli were barely distinguishable at the outset,
any lapse of attention, any decline in the vividness of
the sensations, would blot them out altogether; they
would disappear. The sensations did disappear, after
a few seconds; and then, after another few seconds,
came back; and so the conclusion was drawn that
attention fluctuates, that we can attend to a single
simple impression only for a few seconds at a time. No
doubt attention fluctuates; but these experiments, unfortunately,
are not to the point; for the disappearance
and reappearance of the sensations can be accounted for
by changes in the sense-organ, by adaptation, by twitching
of the eyes, and so on. Other experiments have
therefore been suggested. If we have recourse to smell
and touch, we find that the course of adaptation to an
odour, or to the pressure of a small weight laid upon the
skin, may be followed attentively, without noticeable
fluctuation, for two or three minutes; and the observers
report that they could have kept up their attention still
longer. Again, however, objection may be raised; for
as adaptation advances, the sensation grows fainter and
fainter; and the attention is thus continually spurred
to hold it; the observer is not attending to an unchanging
process, but is sharpening his attention to something
that becomes more and more difficult to fix. Here we
are, for the present, at a standstill. <i>There is no doubt
that attention fluctuates</i>; the bare fact is plain enough in
our everyday experience; but we have no experimental
ground for a more definite statement.</p>

<p>Experiments have also been made to determine the
<b>bodily changes</b> which occur in the state of secondary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
attention (p. 102). It is found that the volume of the
brain increases, while the volume of the arm (save in
experiments in which tactual stimuli are employed) decreases.
Breathing becomes shallower; and expiration
becomes relatively longer as compared with inspiration,
so that the quotient <i>I</i>: <i>E</i>, time of inspiration divided
by time of expiration, becomes less. There are changes
in the rate of pulse; but they seem to differ according as
the attention is ‘sensory’ or ‘intellectual,’&mdash;according,
that is, as the focal process is a sensation or something
more complicated, a perception or idea: in sensory
attention the pulse beats more slowly, in intellectual
attention more quickly, than its normal rate. It is
natural that the blood, in attention, should be drawn
from the members to the brain; it is natural, too, that
this rule should be broken when a limb is itself the ‘object’
of attention; and we all know that there is a tendency,
when we are attentive, to hold the breath; so that
the changes of volume and breathing are not surprising.
Nothing more can be said at present of the changes in
rate of pulse.</p>


<p class="p2"><a name="c106" id="c106">§ 23</a>. <b>The Nervous Correlate of Attention.</b>&mdash;It remains
to say a word about the nature of the nerve-forces
(§ 20) which underlie attention. Physiologists tell
us that one nervous process may influence another in
two opposite ways: by helping and by hindering, or,
in technical terms, by <b>reinforcement</b> and <b>inhibition</b>.
Let us take an elementary example of what they mean.
Suppose that a frog has been reduced, by the removal
of its cerebral hemispheres, to a mere nerve-and-muscle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
machine; it lives, but it cannot sense or feel, and it
does not move ‘of its own accord.’ If, now, a weak
pressure is applied to the frog’s hind foot, there is no
visible response; the limb remains passive. But if
at the same moment a light is flashed into the eye, the
leg-muscles may be thrown into strong contraction.
Here we must suppose that the two nervous processes,
from skin and eye, have in some way helped each other;
there is nervous reinforcement. If, again, a pressure
is applied to a certain part of the frog’s body, the animal
croaks. If a strong pressure is applied to another
part of the body, it replies by a contraction of the muscles.
If, however, the two pressures are applied together,
the frog does not both croak and move; it does
neither; there is no response to the stimuli. Here,
therefore, we must suppose that the two nervous processes
interfere with each other; there is nervous inhibition.</p>

<p>It seems plain that these two influences are at work
among the nervous processes correlated with attention.
<i>The vivid sensations at the focus are sensations whose
corresponding nervous processes have been reinforced, and
the dim sensations of the background are sensations whose
corresponding nervous processes have been inhibited.</i> No
doubt, the distribution of these forces, in a given instance,
is really a matter of <i>degree</i>; the reinforced nervous
process receives more reinforcement than inhibition,
and conversely. No doubt, also, the <i>removal</i> of an
existing inhibition may produce the same effect as the
addition of a reinforcement, and conversely. We are
still too much in the dark as regards the intimate character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of the nerve-forces, we know too little of their
actual course as nervous function in nervous structure,
to be able properly to distinguish cases. There is evidence
that <i>inhibition</i> may be extraordinarily effective:
thus the late Dr. W. B. Carpenter relates that he “has
frequently begun a lecture, whilst suffering neuralgic
pain so severe as to make him apprehend that he would
find it impossible to proceed; yet no sooner has he, by a
determined effort, fairly launched himself into the stream
of thought, than he has found himself continuously
borne along without the least distraction, until the end
has come, and the attention has been released; when
the pain has recurred with a force that has overmastered
all resistance, making him wonder how he could ever
have ceased to feel it.” <i>Reinforcement</i> also may be
carried to a high degree: how else could the listener
follow the part assigned to some special group of instruments
in the orchestra, while he still hears the full harmony?
and how, still more, could the conductor single
out the particular violin-player, who has mistaken a
note, from the group of sixteen who are all playing precisely
the same part?</p>

<p>We may suppose, therefore, that <i>one and the same
pattern of attention is due to very varied combinations of
reinforcing and inhibiting nerve-forces</i>. How then shall
we account for the fact that, in any given instance,
vividness and obscurity are inversely proportional
(p. 100)? The reason seems to be&mdash;though we could
not have learned it from the experiments on the frog&mdash;that
a reinforcement and a corresponding inhibition
always go hand in hand; you cannot reinforce one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
process without at the same time inhibiting others,
and you cannot inhibit without reinforcing. <i>The
nerve-forces are thus interlinked or, as we might say,
double-acting.</i> We are struck by the inhibition in Carpenter’s
case; but the case has another side; for the
more successful the inhibition of the neuralgia, the better
was the lecture delivered. So we are struck by the
reinforcement in the case of the conductor; but that,
too, has another side; for the keener his attention to the
music, the more oblivious is he of his other surroundings.
We shall come back later to this notion of the
interlinking of the nerve-forces, and shall indicate the
evidence upon which it rests.</p>

<p>In summary, we may repeat our general statement
that <i>vividness is paralleled by nervous reinforcement, and
obscurity by nervous inhibition</i>. Only we must realise
that the processes actually going on in the brain may
be very complicated; many separate forces may be at
work behind the single mental pattern, and their action
may be brought about in different ways; and we must
remember also that every one of these separate forces
is double-faced, reinforcing and inhibiting at the same
time.</p>

<p class="pc2"><b><a name="c110" id="c110"></a>Questions and Exercises</b></p>

<p class="p1">(1) “So numerous and varied are the ramifications of
attention, that we find it defined by competent authorities
as a state of muscular contraction and adaptation, as a pure
mental activity, as an emotion or feeling, and as a change in
the clearness of ideas. Each of the definitions can be justified
from the facts, if we put the chief emphasis now upon one
phase and now upon another of its varied expressions”
(W. B. Pillsbury, Attention, 1908, 1). Discuss this passage.</p>


<p>(2) Give instances, from your own experience, of the three
levels of attention. Trace the development (still from your
own experience) of derived primary from secondary attention.</p>


<p>(3) Describe carefully the attitudes (<i>a</i>) of the scout
(secondary visual attention) and (<i>b</i>) of the eavesdropper
(secondary auditory attention). How do you account for
their difference?</p>


<p>(4) A child that has fallen and hurt itself stops crying if
you offer it a toy; a soldier who in the heat of battle has
received a serious wound may know nothing of it, and may
go on fighting till he drops from exhaustion; many a martyr
has suffered at the stake with calm serenity. How far are
these cases explicable by the laws of attention?</p>


<p>(5) Criticise Sir Wm. Hamilton’s experiment. Do not
be satisfied till you have found several reasons for distrusting
its result.</p>


<p>(6) Do the lower animals ever give evidence of derived
primary attention?</p>


<p>(7) You can follow the movement of a single instrument in
the orchestra better, when it has been playing a solo before,
than when the whole group of instruments begin together.
Why is this? Give other instances of the same law.</p>


<p>(8) It has been proposed to measure the degree of attention
by measuring the degree of effort which accompanies it.
What have you to say to the proposal?</p>


<p>(9) How could you tell, by outward observation, whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
a child is attentive or inattentive? and whether it is adequate
to its task or is in difficulties? Do not just list the
symptoms; make your answer psychological.</p>


<p>(10) Determine the range of attention (<i>a</i>) by help of an
ordinary metronome, set at various rates. You must not
count the beats, since every count would mean a separate
attention. Determine the range also (<i>b</i>) by help of the letter-diagram
and cardboard screen figured by W. Wundt, An Introduction
to Psychology, 1912, 19. Notice the remark
(p. 23) that the experimenter must practise covering and uncovering
the diagram.</p>


<p>(11) Paint or paste a small disc of light grey on a white
cardboard ground. Move so far away that the spot is only
just distinguishable. Call out Gone! and Back! as it disappears
and reappears, and have the times noted on the
seconds-dial of a watch. Explain the fluctuation, in your own
words, as due to adaptation and eye-movement. Can you devise
a simple method of showing (by means of the negative
after-image) that unnoticed eye-movements really occur?</p>


<p>(12) St. Thomas asks whether the mind can grasp more
than one thing at a time; and replies that it can, if the various
things are regarded as making up a single whole, but that it
cannot, if they are regarded in their variety and particularity.
Can you put all this into psychological language? And can
you find any difference between St. Thomas’ question and
our own question as to the range of attention?</p>

<p>§ 24. <b>The Problem in General.</b>&mdash;The chapters on
the mental elements&mdash;sensation, simple image, feeling&mdash;have
made you acquainted with the <i>results</i> of psychological
analysis; it was only occasionally that you
were asked to analyse for yourself. Henceforth we
shall be dealing with experiences that offer themselves
<i>for</i> analysis; with experiences that, however simple they
may at first sight appear, turn out on investigation to
be complex. We shall thus be following the example
of those men who, long centuries ago, tried to bring
order into mental phenomena and to establish a science
of mind. We have an enormous advantage; for they
were working in the dark, and we are working in the
light of their discoveries. Still, our procedure will be
the same as theirs; and the change of work brings with
it certain difficulties that you must realise at the outset
and be ready to face. Well begun is half done.</p>

<p>First of all, then, your reading henceforth will be
more difficult, because you will have to <i>keep more things
in mind</i>. The analysis even of so comparatively simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
a thing as a perception or idea cannot be performed in
one breath. A knot in a rope may be beautifully simple,
and yet you may spend a week in learning it! Secondly,
the examples chosen by the author may not be just the
right <i>examples</i> for you; even perceptions and ideas,
again, differ a good deal in different minds; and an example
that is illuminating to one reader may leave
another quite blind. So you must look for your own
examples in your own experience. Thirdly, you have
now to wrestle with the problem of <i>meaning</i> (p. 26); for
all perceptions and ideas, and all our still more complicated
experiences, mean something; a perception is
always the perception <i>of</i> a tree or a wedding or what not;
and an idea too is always the idea <i>of</i> something, whether
of the landing of Columbus or of the quarrels of the gods
in Homer. You must get clear, then, about the psychology
of meaning. Fourthly, these concrete experiences
that you are to analyse have a long <i>history</i>; and
in seeking their nervous correlates we shall be obliged,
oftentimes, to go far back, even beyond the individual,
to the development of the race. In doing this we do
not change the problem of psychology (p. 18), but we
enlarge our view of it; a mere reference to the organ
of sense or the present condition of the nervous system
is no longer enough.</p>

<p>All this means, in summary, that we are passing from
the abstract to the concrete, from the meaningless to
the meaningful, from the simple to the complex. We
still keep to our scientific point of view, and we still
employ our scientific method. The change is not in
us, who are psychologising, but in our subject-matter;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the plot begins to thicken; and this growing complexity
of subject-matter naturally makes increasing demand
upon our scientific resources.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c114" id="c114">§ 25</a>. <b>The Analysis of Perception and Idea.</b>&mdash;Sensations
and simple images can hardly occur, by themselves
alone, in our everyday experience. The practised
psychologist may be able to focalise a sensation,
to make it so vivid that it stands out almost as it would
under the experimental control of the laboratory; but
his is an exceptional case. The units of our daily experience
are rather such things as the sound of the piano
in the next room, the sight of the tree budding just
outside the window, the memory of last winter’s snow-piles,
the forecast of to-night’s Pathetic Symphony;
that is, they are <i>perceptions</i> and <i>ideas</i>. Notice that
they come to us in the first place as units, as wholes;
they show no lines of natural cleavage; they are unitary
and self-contained. Yet they are not psychologically
simple; if they were, we should never have lit upon
sensations and simple images. <i>All perceptions and
ideas may be analysed.</i></p>

<p>A typical <b>perception</b> <i>resolves, to begin with, into a
number of sensations</i>. The sound of the piano is, after
all, the sound of certain compound tones, played together
and in succession; and the sight of the tree is an
arrangement of colours. The characteristic part of a
perception, then, the part that we may conveniently
call its core or nucleus, may thus be analysed into sensations.
Only the core, however; for <i>the sensations are
supplemented, secondly, by various images</i>. The sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
comes to us as the sound of <i>the</i> piano, the instrument
of that familiar look; and we may have an imaginal
hint of the child playing, of the score, of its special
difficulties, of all sorts of related things. The tree, too,
is <i>that</i> tree, the familiar cherry that the caterpillars
infest so badly, that grew so much last year, that will
presently cut off the view across the street, that very
likely will interfere with the beech. Remember that
these are the author’s instances, and that you must
replace them by your own! The point is that the
complement of images is there; and you will notice
that it is not stable; it may be full or scant, and it may
lead the mind this way or that; but, whatever it be,
it puts more into the perception than the sensory
stimuli can account for; we perceive more than we hear
or see.</p>

<p>Yes, and we perceive more than is furnished us by
sensations and images. It is a fact (which you will
better understand presently) that <i>every perception is
shaped and moulded by the action of nerve-forces which
show themselves neither in sensation nor in image</i>. The
nervous system, whether by racial heritage or by individual
habit, meets its impressions halfway, and throws
them into certain customary forms. We take both the
tree and the piano to be real things, and we take them
to be things that occupy real space; we perceive them as
objects of the outside world, and we perceive them as
solid or space-filling. We do this because we have a
natural and ingrained tendency to cast our perceptions
into the forms of ‘thing’ and ‘space’; and this tendency
of the nervous system does its work automatically;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
it has no correlate of sensation or image; but it is none
the less effective, so to say, <i>behind</i> the sensations and
the images, in determining the perception. You must
just accept this statement now; it will become clearer
later on.</p>

<p>A typical <b>idea</b>, in the same way, <i>has a core or nucleus
of images</i>. Last winter’s snow may come to us in many
different ways, because our equipment of images is
very variable (pp. 75 f.); it will come to most, perhaps,
as a visual picture, an uneven spread of white, with
streaks of grey-brown on the peaks and along the valleys,
honeycombed and broken from some partial
thaw. To-night’s music will come, possibly, as the
sound of the opening adagio measures, or of some theme
from the allegro. Here again, however, the nucleus
has its surroundings; <i>other images cluster about it</i>;
we recall the day so-and-so got his feet wet, or the big
fall of that December Thursday; we see our place in
the concert-hall, or hope that this time the tympani
will be in tune. <i>Nor is the idea altogether a matter of
images.</i> We can hardly think of those opening measures
without kinæsthetic sensations from the throat,
or from some muscular beat of the rhythm; we can
hardly think of getting our feet wet, or of seating ourselves
in the hall, without some actual movement that
arouses sensation. Find your own instances, once
more, and do not trust the author! You will find that
<i>the typical idea is thus in part sensation, just as the typical
perception is in part image</i>. Finally, the idea, too,
is subject to the pressure of the <i>directive nerve-forces</i>;
it takes the same customary forms as the perception.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Columbus is thought of as a real person, acting in a real
world of space and time; and Zeus as an imaginary
person in an imaginary world; but there is no difference
in the form of the ideas, and no difference of form
between these ideas and the perception of the stranger
who has just passed the window.</p>

<p>So we have <i>the characteristic nucleus; the varying complement;
and the brain-habit behind all</i>. And if we can
analyse the perception or idea, nucleus and surroundings
both, into its mental elements; if we can say what
nervous processes are correlated with these elementary
mental processes; and if we can further establish the
nature of the guiding and shaping nerve-forces; then
our psychological account will be, in strictness, complete.
Yet we shall have passed over something that,
as we have ourselves admitted, is in everyday life most
strikingly characteristic of these experiences; the fact,
namely, that they <b>mean</b>; that our perception of the
tree means the tree, is a perception <i>of</i> that tree, and our
idea of snow means the snow, is an idea <i>of</i> that snow.
<i>What, then, from the psychological point of view, is this
meaning?</i></p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c117" id="c117">§ 26</a>. <b>Meaning in Perception and Idea.</b>&mdash;We learned
in § 6 that mental processes are not intrinsically meaningful,
that meaning is not a constituent part of their
nature. We have seen, indeed, that the whole notion
of meaning is really foreign to science. When we ask,
then, what meaning is, from the psychological point of
view, are we not asking an irrelevant and unscientific
question?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Not necessarily. A science cannot free itself, offhand,
from its own history; and, historically, psychology has
been much concerned with meaning. Moreover, meaning
is of very great practical importance; we communicate
meanings, we apprehend meanings, we act upon
meanings; and although science is not bound to treat
only of what is practically important, yet it can hardly
neglect a matter of great practical importance that
comes its way. Our question, if we rephrase it a little,
merely asks <i>that a term, familiar to us in our daily life,
be translated into the language of science</i>; and if the
translation out of common sense into science is to be
made at all, psychology is the science in which the
equivalent of meaning will be found. For these reasons
we are justified in discussing the matter here; and
the question at issue&mdash;let us be quite clear about it&mdash;is
this: What mental processes, in perception and
idea, are the scientific equivalent of what we know in
everyday life as meaning? <i>what processes carry the
meaning?</i></p>

<p>The answer is that the processes which surround the
nucleus carry the meaning. <i>Psychologically regarded,
meaning is always context</i>; and the context is the fringe
of related processes that gathers about the central group
of sensations or images. Ordinarily, as our analysis
has shown, the two come together; but they may be
disjoined. When the word ‘house’ becomes meaningless
with repetition (p. 26), it is because the bare sound
grows more and more vivid and dominant; like the nestling
cuckoo, it drives out its normal associates; and
these associates, the carriers of its meaning, sink lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
and lower into the obscurity of the background. So the
meaning, almost literally, drops off, falls away. When
one and the same experience has different meanings, it
is because the context varies; we read, for instance,
that so-and-so received a warm welcome, and we put
directly opposite interpretations on the words, according
as so-and-so was friend or enemy. When we mistake
a meaning, it is because we supply a context of
our own: what child, reading that “the quality of mercy
is not strain’d,” has not thought of mercy being wrung
out through a strainer, as the cook wrings the water
out of cottage-cheese in a muslin bag? The context
of images is obvious; the rain falls freely, like water
poured through a sieve; but what is <i>strained</i> comes out
grudgingly in drops. When one and the same meaning
attaches to several experiences, it is because these
different experiences are received into the same context,
or into a context so nearly the same that for practical
purposes the differences disappear; for example, the
experiences may be named, that is, may be received
into a context of verbal ideas; and verbal ideas tend
to become stereotyped, as it were, into permanent
groups. All the facts of § 6 are to be accounted
for in this way, by the distinction of nucleus and
context.</p>

<p><i>Originally, we must suppose, meaning was carried exclusively
by kinæsthetic and organic sensations.</i> Think
of the animal that we pictured on p. 101 as startled by
some sudden stimulus and as facing the stimulus by way
of a bodily attitude; the sensation is hemmed in, like
a jewel in its setting, by the sensations of organic stir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and motor posture; and these sensations give the meaning;
they cry out ‘Danger!’; they are the psychological
equivalent, the carriers, of that meaning; without
them the sensation would be meaningless. <i>Meaning
is thus older than the free image</i>; and kinæsthesis is
still, for many of us, the characteristic context, the common
denominator of our meanings; we hinted at this
rôle on p. 47. None the less, the development of free
images, the images of memory and imagination, changes
the whole situation; kinæsthesis now has many rivals;
and it depends on our individual equipment of images,
on our ‘type of mind,’ whether a meaning shall be
carried by a quiver of the stomach or some muscular
set, or whether it shall be carried by some complex of
images. If we were to work out a great number of
cases, we should probably find that <i>any sensory or
imaginal process whatsoever is able, in our adult human
experience, to carry the meaning of any other</i>.</p>

<p>There is yet a further stage: a stage in which <i>meaning
is carried not by any sort of sensation or image, but simply
and solely by physiological processes</i>, by some set or disposition
of the brain. When the practised reader skims a
number of pages in quick succession; when the musician
renders a composition in the prescribed key;
when an accomplished linguist shifts from one language
to another as he turns to his right or left hand neighbour
at a dinner table; in cases of this kind there need be
no discoverable context; the stimuli press the button,
and the brain, prepared by constant practice in the
past, now does the rest. The experiences <i>mean</i>, positively
enough; the ‘sense’ of the pages is grasped, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the eye hurries over the lines; the three flats on the staff
set the player’s hand and eye for the key of E♭; the
question put in French is suitably answered in the
same language; everything takes place <i>as if</i> there were
a fringe of images that gave meaning to the bare perceptions;
and yet imaginal fringe and kinæsthetic setting
may be conspicuous only by their absence. Of
course, there <i>has been</i> context; one does not learn
French and German, or transpose on the piano, by gift
of a ready-made nervous system; even after years of
work one may be a little uncertain of the German auxiliaries,
or have a repugnance to four sharps. The point
is, however, that an habitual and often-repeated context
does, presently, lapse altogether; the nucleus is
not always supplemented; the nervous system can now
do, by a set or disposition that has no mental correlate,
what it used to do by processes that had as accompaniment
the sensations or images of the context.</p>

<p>It is plain, therefore, that <i>perception and idea are not
always so rich and complicated as we have described them</i>;
we spoke, for that very reason, of the ‘typical’ perception
and idea. They range, according to their age and
use, from the cluster of nuclear processes surrounded
by a group of contextual associates, all under the guidance
of a directive nerve-force, down to a mere rag
and tag of sensory or imaginal process, wholly bare of
associates, and dependent for its meaning upon some
habitual nervous set.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c121" id="c121">§ 27</a>. <b>The Types of Perception.</b>&mdash;Our perceptions
are based upon three of the attributes or aspects of sensation:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
upon quality, upon duration, and upon extension
(p. 66).</p>

<p>The <b>quality</b> of sensation has already been discussed.
We may take, as instances of qualitative perception,
the taste of coffee, the resistance of a jammed door,
and the note of a musical instrument. The <i>taste of
coffee</i> analyses into sensations of bitter, the real taste
of the coffee-berry; of warmth; of pressure, the feel
of the liquid in the mouth; and of a peculiar fragrance,
the odour of coffee. Along with these goes a colour,
the clear or clouded brown of the coffee in the cup,
and various other contextual processes. The <i>resistance</i>
analyses into the qualities of pressure from the skin;
of strain from the tendons of the arm; and of pressure,
or something akin to pressure, from the binding of the
joints and the contraction of the muscles. There is probably
some organic stir; there is the sight of the door;
and there may be a further context. The <i>musical note</i>
analyses into fundamental tone and overtones, and into
the noise characteristic of the instrument; the thud of
the piano, the scrape of the violin, the pluck of the
harp. The supplement is perhaps visual; but here,
as in the other cases, verbal ideas may enter into the
context; we may think ‘Violin, of course,’ All our
qualitative perceptions are of this kind; they come to
us as meaningful wholes, and they may be analysed
into a number of sensory qualities, run or fused or
blended together, and set in various contexts of associated
processes.</p>

<p>The attribute of <b>duration</b> has not yet been defined.
It is the bare going on, going forward, keeping like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
itself, that may be observed in any and every sensation;
you recognise it most easily, perhaps, if you listen to a
tone, or attend to the kinæsthetic complex as you slowly
extend your arm from the elbow. It is <i>the elementary
time-factor in all our perceptions of time</i>,&mdash;in the perceptions
of period, of interval, of rate, of rhythm, and
so on; though in some of these perceptions it is overlaid
and obscured by other factors. Qualitative perceptions
undergo relatively little change, just because
they are qualitative perceptions; the best and easiest
way to <i>mean</i> a quality is to <i>be</i> it; the best way to mean
the coffee-taste is to be the coffee-taste; and so our
perception of that taste remains practically the same all
our life long. Time-perceptions, on the other hand,&mdash;and
the same thing is true of space-perceptions,&mdash;change
enormously; the nervous system finds all manner
of short-cuts to the meaning of time; and these
short-cuts have to be <i>un</i>practised, to be practised out,
if we are to observe the perception in its original form.
Thus, to take the simplest case, a period of time may
seem long because the kinæsthetic strain of waiting
becomes intense, or because a great number of perceptions
and ideas occur during its course; the strain and
the number of ideas have come to <i>mean</i> length of time,
and the primary experience of duration, so to say,
drops out of sight. If, therefore, we wish our observers
in the laboratory to compare periods of time; if we wish
to find out accurately what durations can be grasped
by the attention and held in the memory; then we must
break them of these time-habits, and must somehow
train them to disregard strain and to discard imagery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
We cannot often carry the unravelling of a perception
to the very end, though we can go some distance behind
the appearances of everyday life.</p>

<p>The attribute of <b>extension</b> is the bare character of
patch or spread that inheres in all sensations from eye
and skin, and possibly also in kinæsthetic and organic
sensations. No point of light or pressure is so fine that
it is not areal. Extension is <i>the elementary space-factor
in all our perceptions of space</i>. It enters most obviously
into the perception of surface, as duration enters most
obviously into that of period; but it is the basis also
of our perceptions of form, size, distance, locality, direction.
Like duration, it is often obscured and overlaid
by other factors.</p>

<p>Here, however, you will raise an objection. Have
we not said, on p. 115, that perception is shaped and
moulded by nerve-forces that have no mental correlates?
and did we not take as an example the casting of
perceptions into the forms of ‘thing’ and ‘space’?
How, then, can we now speak of perceptions <i>of</i> space?&mdash;Well,
for one thing, there are various kinds of spatial
perception; and it will not do to assume that they are
all alike a matter of brain-habit, without mental correlate.
Secondly, however, there is a difference between
perceiving the piano or the tree <i>as</i> spatial, and turning
our attention directly upon its spatial characters, its
size or form, its distance or direction. In the latter
case, we may rightly speak of a perception of space;
we may so speak, even if the various kinds of spatial
perception do turn out to be matters of brain-habit;
and we must examine every kind for itself, precisely in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
order to determine how far it is sensory and imaginal,
and how far it is a form impressed on sensations and
images by the trend of the processes in the brain.</p>

<p>So the objection is answered. Coming back to the
subject, we note that some of our more <b>complex perceptions</b>
have a twofold basis: thus the perception of
melody is at once qualitative and temporal, and the
perception of movement is at once temporal and spatial.
Nay more, the perception of a scene, a situation, an
event, is threefold: qualitative, temporal and spatial;
think of a scene of grand opera, or of an accident on the
street. In general, the analysis of these complex perceptions
follows from that of the simpler modes, though
every one of them has its own psychological problem.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that we have not distinguished
a group of perceptions based upon sensory <b>intensity</b>.
The fact is, however, that while intensity enters into
all sorts of perceptions (lemonade must not be too sour,
the members of a rhythm must be variously accented,
a distant sound is faint), it only rarely characterises a
perception; and when it does, the perception thus characterised
belongs to one or other of the groups already
mentioned. We say ‘What a heavy child!’&mdash;but the
perception of weight, like that of resistance, is itself
qualitative. Or we say of a certain composer ‘He always
overdoes the drums!’&mdash;but the drum-rhythm
is itself a temporal perception. <i>We cannot point, then,
to a separate class of intensive perceptions.</i></p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c125" id="c125">§ 28</a>. <b>The Perception of Distance.</b>&mdash;A complete
psychology of perception would contain an analytical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
treatment, up to the limits of our present knowledge, of
all the various perceptions, qualitative, temporal and
spatial, as well as complex, that occur in experience.
Such a treatment is here out of the question. We
must pick and choose; and as a sample of perception at
large we shall consider the <i>perception of distance</i>. We
seem, quite immediately and directly, to <i>see</i> distances;
we see that our friend is coming nearer, we see that he
has passed the bridge, we see that he is entering the
gate, we see when to shake hands with him. Yet there
is no sensation of distance, and there is no specific stimulus
to distance. What, then, really happens?</p>

<p>In the first place, there are plenty of <b>visual cues</b> to
distance. We take familiar things to be far off if they
look small, and near by if they look large; the size of
the men and vehicles in the street makes us realise the
height of the building we are gazing down from. We
take things to be far off, again, if they are hazy and bluish,
near by if they are clearly outlined and varied in colour;
everyone knows or has read of the deceptive nearness of
distant mountains in clear dry air. We notice the distribution
of light and shade; a morning or evening landscape,
a shaded face or sphere, looks deeper, more solid,
more plastic, than the landscape at high noon or the
outline drawing. We notice the course of boundary
lines and the visibility of surfaces; that is nearer which
cuts across the rest or blots part of it out; the telephone
wire is thus nearer than the elm, and the elm is nearer
than the house. We notice the number of objects that
the eye must traverse to arrive at its goal; and the
more numerous the objects, the farther off do we take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the goal to be; the town looks near, we say, but there
are all those fields, and the wood, and the churchyard,
and half-a-dozen farmhouses to pass, and then the outlying
houses; it must be a good two miles. We get
various hints from movement; a crawling train or car
is far away; and if we are looking at a near object and
move the head to one side, distant objects move in the
same direction, while if we are looking at a far object
and move the head, near objects go in the opposite
direction; and so on. <i>All these things&mdash;linear perspective,
aerial perspective, chiaroscuro, interposition, number,
movement&mdash;are, however, secondary affairs</i>; they represent
short-cuts to the meaning of distance (p. 123); they do
not lead us to the perception of distance itself. At the
same time, we should bear in mind that these secondary
processes were there, ready to take up the burden of
meaning, all the while that the perception was forming.</p>

<p>Having thus cleared the ground, we naturally appeal
to experiment; but unfortunately the first step that
we take lands us in difficulties. It is found that, when
all the cues above mentioned are ruled out, the estimation
of distance is still possible; and many psychologists
believe that it depends upon <b>kinæsthetic sensations</b>
set up in and about the eye. Each eyeball is slung in
its orbit upon six muscles; and the contraction of these
muscles is, naturally, greater for convergence of the
eyes upon near objects than for their convergence upon
far; so that the <i>sensations of convergence</i> seem fitted to
play a part in the perception of distance. If only one
eye is used, these sensations may be replaced by others,
derived from the muscular system, within the eyeball,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
that adjusts or accommodates the lens for clear vision
at different objective distances. The <i>sensations of
accommodation</i>, though, in ordinary binocular vision
they are entirely subordinate to the sensations of convergence,
can nevertheless&mdash;within a lesser range of
distances&mdash;play the same part in perception. Unfortunately,
as was hinted just now, the results of these
experiments are disputed; we shall come back to them,
and to the possible rôle of the kinæsthetic sensations,
later on.</p>

<p>Meantime, what is to be said of the <b>eyes</b> themselves,
and of the impression that a solid object, a tridimensional
stimulus, makes upon them? If you hold up a
closed book, back towards you, in the middle line of the
face, and if you observe it alternately with the right and
left eye, you will find that the two views do not tally;
the left eye sees the back and the cover to the left, the
right eye sees the back and the cover to the right. If
you now make outline drawings of the two views, mount
them upon a suitable card, and look at them through a
<b>stereoscope</b>,&mdash;which, as you know, combines them
into a single view,&mdash;lo! you have before you a solid
book, the back near you, and the edges away in space.
<i>It is as if the two eyes had reconciled their conflicting
views, and the result were depth or solidity.</i></p>

<p>But is not this the very thing we were in search of?
have we not at last got at the secret of visible depth?
No; we are rather <i>at the crucial point of our discussion</i>.
For this binocular picture, the image seen in the stereoscope,
cannot be, of its own nature and in its own right,
deep or solid, unless there is a depth-sensation; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
conclusion goes against everything that we know both
of sensation and of the stimuli that arouse sensation.
To avoid it, some psychologists call in the kinæsthetic
sensations from the muscles of the eye. <i>Depth or distance,
they say, is psychologically a blend or fusion of
visual and kinæsthetic sensations.</i> Our binocular view
of the book, its appearance to the two eyes, is in itself
flat; but we run the eyes over it, and the muscular sensations
thus blend with the visual. Nay more, even if
we hold our eyes fixed, there is still a <i>tendency</i> to move
them; and this tendency, now ingrained in our nervous
system, is enough to realise the perception. Indeed,
if experiment fails in every case to show the sensations
of convergence and accommodation, that is just because
the fusion is so long-established and so ingrained;
we perceive distance, the fusion itself; we can hardly
expect to recover the kinæsthetic sensations that originally
entered into it; the wonder rather is that they
should ever appear, that experiment should be able to
reveal them at all.</p>

<p>No one can say positively that this hypothesis is
wrong; but it is difficult to believe that the blend of
visual and kinæsthetic sensations should yield a result
so different from either,&mdash;namely, the perception of
space. It seems safer to say that <i>the binocular picture</i>,
the appearance of the book to the two eyes or the combined
image of the stereoscope, <i>carries the immediate
meaning of depth or voluminousness</i>. The picture is
not itself deep or solid; but we cannot help perceiving
it <i>as</i> deep and solid; and this pressure is laid upon us
by what we have called racial heritage, an inherited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
disposition of the nervous system: <i>the brain meets the
impression halfway</i>. The binocular picture thus becomes
the core or nucleus of the perception; and the
meaning of depth is carried by a nervous disposition
that has no correlate in sensation or image. The
kinæsthetic sensations may then very well serve, as a
secondary context, to give precision and accuracy to the
perception, to develop the perception of crude voluminousness
into the perception of definite distances. As
to the nervous disposition, we can only say that it has
been set up by the same biological causes that have
made the organism a motor organism, one that moves
freely in space; beyond that general statement we cannot
go.</p>

<p>So far we have dealt with the space of sight; but
there is also a <b>space of touch</b>; and we have next to ask
<i>whether the perception of distance can be couched in terms
of touch alone</i>. Our appeal lies to those who are born
blind. Observations show that, in their case, the
direct perception of solidity, of plasticity, is rare and
fleeting; it arises, perhaps, when they clasp a child to
their breast, or when they have been trained by long
manipulation to distinguish objects of various shapes
and sizes; it does not form a permanent item of their
mental furniture. The blind <i>behave as if</i> they perceived
distance; they avoid obstacles,&mdash;near obstacles
by the pressure or temperature of the air reflected back
upon their face, and remote obstacles by sounds; they
can be taught geometry, and they measure objective
distances by pacing; but the meaning of distance seems
always to remain abstract, very much as the meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of light and colour must remain abstract; there is no
realising perception of distance. The brain mechanism
which is ready to act at once at the behest of sight thus
seems to be lacking where touch alone is present; even
the perception of crude volume, of depth, has to be
built up afresh by the individual. <i>The blind live mainly
in a world of sounds</i>; touch is employed, as a rule, only
for special and limited purposes, such as dressing,
reading, handicraft; and their world is therefore not
pervasively spatial, like the world of the seeing.</p>

<p>Go back now, for a moment, to the objection raised
on p. 124! We have, as a matter of fact, been led to
the belief that <b>the meaning of depth is carried, in the
last resort, by a brain-habit</b>. But how differently
does this sentence read before and after the discussion!
You have learned something of the difficulties
of the study of perception; you see why it is necessary
to look at perception historically, developmentally;
you have been taken behind the obvious visual cues to
the perception itself; you have seen how the kinæsthetic
sensations and the binocular picture may be made
the subject of experiment. Even the bare outline that
the narrow compass of the present book allows should
convince you that the objection was duly answered.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c131" id="c131">§ 29</a>. <b>The Problem in Detail.</b>&mdash;Every one of our
familiar perceptions might, now, be treated in this same
fashion, and in indefinitely greater detail. We should
start out with our pattern of sensory nucleus, imaginal
context, and brain-habit; and we should push our
analysis back and back, in the effort to reach the primary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and ultimate form of the perception we were discussing.
The quest is fascinating; for these are old,
old bits of the mental life; to trace them home would
be to go back to the Stone Age&mdash;or further; the earliest
men we know of perceived the things that we perceive.
Whether psychology will ever reach the final goal cannot
be said; but at any rate the problems are genuine
problems; they can be resolved only by intensive and
long-continued work; and they demand an extraordinary
ingenuity in the devising of experimental controls
and an unusual degree of patience in experimenting.
Men spend their lives among dead languages and buried
cities; why not excavate and explore the inner world
of perception?</p>

<p>Let us take an instance or two. Consider, first, the
perception of <b>movement by the eye</b>. Many psychologists
assume outright a special sensation of movement,
something that we might call a <i>travel-sensation</i>. That
hypothesis cuts the difficulty; but the sensation is no
more admissible than the depth-sensation, and for
like reasons. Other psychologists call attention, in a
more scientific spirit, to the fact that in all cases of sudden
change there is a <i>sensory index</i> of that change. If,
for instance, a tone is quickly changed to a higher tone,
or a light suddenly reduced to a duller light, there is a
moment of sensory blur or confusion, a moment in
which the quality or intensity ceases to be clear and
distinct; so that, if you were called upon to identify it,
you could say only ‘It lies somewhere about such-and-such
a part of the scale.’ <i>This blur is the sensory index
of change</i>; not a new sensation, but a modification of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
existing sensation. We have it in the perception of
visual movement; there is a blur of positions; and it
may reasonably be referred to the positive after-image.
A shooting-star flashes across the sky; it leaves a trail
of after-image as it moves; you see it both at the place
it started from, and at the place where it disappears,
all in the same present time; thinking of it, nevertheless,
as a star, a point of light like other stars, you perceive
movement. The same thing holds for the perception
of rapid movement on the skin.</p>

<p>So far everything is in order. Now, however, let
us make a simple experiment. You know the <b>stroboscope</b>
or zoetrope that is sold in the toy-shops: a cardboard
drum, open at the top, that twirls on a handle;
a strip of paper, on which are printed phases of some
movement (the flight of a bird, the gallop of a horse), is
placed inside, round the bottom of the drum; and you
look down at the strip, while the instrument revolves,
through vertical slits cut at regular intervals in the upper
half of the drum-wall; you then see a continuous
movement. Suppose that you make a new strip, on
which you draw simply two lines, a vertical and a horizontal;
you draw them some distance apart, but in
such wise that, if they came together, they would form
a right-angle. Turn the drum slowly, and you see the
two lines; turn it swiftly, and you see the right-angle,
like a letter L; turn it at a middle rate, and you see&mdash;according
to the direction of turn&mdash;the vertical <i>fall
over into</i> the horizontal, or the horizontal <i>rise up into</i>
the vertical. You see movement, where there is no
movement to see! Here, then, is a case of <i>perception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
of movement in terms of sheer brain-habit</i>, of a settled
nervous disposition that now has no mental correlate,
but whose establishment has depended on the past
history of the individual, possibly of the race.</p>

<p>Take, as a second instance, the perception of <b>melody</b>.
Primitive melodies seem to be of two types. In the one,
the scale arises by synthesis of small tone-steps or tone-distances,
which are approximately ‘whole tones’;
the melody consists only of two or three of these steps,
and the last and lowest tone is the principal note of the
tune. In the other, the scale arises by analysis of the
larger consonant intervals, fourth and fifth; these
intervals are broken up into smaller steps; the octave
appears as a drone-bass; the first and highest tone is
the principal note. An intermediate type keeps for the
most part to small steps, but shows ascents and descents
<i>portamento</i> through octave, fifth and fourth; it, too,
makes the first and highest tone the principal note. We
can account for a good deal of this development: we
know that the voice cannot be evenly sustained in recitative,
but naturally drops; we have reason to believe
that the memory of absolute pitch is strongly developed
in primitive peoples (parrots repeat their tunes at the
same pitch, and the same thing is largely true of young
children); we know the recurrent tonality of the octave
(p. 52); we know that the fourth is the natural
drop of the voice at the end of a sentence, and the fifth
its natural rise in asking a question; we know that
men, women and boys, singing in ‘unison,’ will really
sing in octaves, and often in fifths and fourths; we know
that the semitone, the final unit of our own scales, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the smallest tone-step that can be accurately sung; we
know that musical instruments were invented very early,
and that they must have helped to give stability to the
vocal scale. These things, however, are not enough.
For behind all music lies what we must call an <b>intent to
express</b>, as behind all speech lies an intent to communicate;
and this intent baffles us; we can only say,
once again, that it is carried by some native and ingrained
disposition of the nervous system. The possibility of
music is further bound up with the possibility of <b>transposition</b>;
the melody must be reproducible and recognisable,
whatever note it start from; and primitive
melodies do in fact begin on different notes, and yet
keep the same form. It may be that the primitive singer
felt his tones, felt the adjustment of his larynx, more
keenly than we do. Movements of the larynx are muscular
contractions, and their sensations are subject to
Weber’s law (p. 68); so that, whether the vocal cords
are slack or tense, their tension must be increased <i>in the
same proportion</i> to get equal differences in muscular
sensation. Here is a possible organic basis for the relative
constancy of the tones within a melody; the difficulty
is that even primitive melodies seem to be shaped,
not by feel, but by ear.</p>

<p>We may take, as a third instance, a group of perceptions
that have been named <b>optical illusions</b>. In a
certain sense, most of our space-perceptions are illusory.
Distance, for example, soon closes up on itself; if we
try to stop, halfway, a friend who is walking down a
long corridor, we shall be likely to call out before he has
gone more than a third of its length. Size is illusory;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the size of the moon in the sky is that of a pea held
at arm’s length before the eyes. Form is illusory:
how often do we see a table square? Only direction is
adequately perceived. Yet we do not, somehow, think
of all these things as illusions; we are used to them, and
can make allowance for them.</p>

<p>There are, on the other hand, certain simple arrangements
of dots and lines that yield, in perception, a result
markedly different from that which measurement would
lead us to expect. These figures have, in recent years,
been made the subject of detailed study; that which is
here shown has, in particular, been repeatedly discussed
and variously explained. The simplicity of the forms
is, indeed, treacherous and misleading; analysis is
very difficult; and there is no present prospect that
investigators will agree.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-136.jpg" width="500" height="190"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>The two horizontal lines are equal in measurement;
they are unequal to the eye. Why? One suggestion
is that <i>the eye moves freely along the one, and hesitatingly
and obstructedly along the other</i>; the obliques tempt out,
in the one case, and hem in, in the other. The suggestion
can be tested; for movements of the eyes can be
recorded; and it turns out to be correct. The eyes,
in passing over a line, like the lines of the figure or of a
printed page, move by sweeps or jerks; they go so far,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
halt, and start again. Experiment shows that movements
along the lower horizontal take a longer sweep,
and oftentimes come to a halt only when they have shot
beyond the end-points of the line; whereas movements
along the upper horizontal are themselves shorter, and
frequently come to a halt before the extremities of the
line have been reached. Here, then, is a kinæsthetic
context to carry the meanings ‘longer’ and ‘shorter.’
Is the analysis adequate? Not for every case; the
illusion is found to vary with <i>our general attitude toward
the figures</i>. If we take them as wholes, the large open
area below and the closed diamond-shaped area above
strike the attention; we say, from total impression, that
the lower horizontal is the longer. If, however, we take
the figures critically, part by part, limiting our attention
to the horizontals and disregarding the obliques, then
the illusion is greatly reduced and may, with practice,
disappear. Here, then, is a second context, which
involves a brain-habit. Another suggestion is that
<i>linear perspective</i> may be at work; the larger figure is
a book opening toward you, the smaller is a book opened
away from you; the lower horizontal is therefore further
off, and should (if the two books were of the same size)
be smaller than the upper; since it is not, the lower
book is seen as the larger. There are, without doubt,
many figures in which perspective influences the perception;
but there seems to be no reason to invoke it here.
A fourth suggestion is that we read into the figures
<i>ideas of our own muscular state</i>; the lower figure has room
to expand, it is stretching and yawning; the upper is
cramped and huddled; and so the illusion of length is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
produced. There is no doubt, again, that this putting
of oneself in place of the lines plays a part in certain
perceptions; but its influence here is negatived by the
swallow figure; the birds flying toward each other are
further apart than those flying from each other. On
the whole, we may be satisfied with the two contexts
first mentioned; the discussion shows, however, how
many and how various motives may enter in to determine
an illusory perception.</p>

<p><a name="c138" id="c138">§ 30</a>. <b>The Types of Idea.</b>&mdash;Idea takes its plan
from perception; and ideas may therefore be classified,
like perceptions, as qualitative, temporal and spatial.
When, however, we speak of <b>types of idea</b>, we usually
have a different classification in view. Our ideas differ
as our equipment of imagery differs; some minds are
rich in visual or auditory images, others are poor or
deficient. When first these differences were brought to
light, they seemed to be permanent and clearly marked;
children, especially, were classed <i>as eye-minded, ear-minded,
and touch-minded</i> or motor-minded, according
as their ideas consisted predominantly of visual, auditory,
or kinæsthetic images; and it was thought no less
necessary to discover a child’s type, and to instruct
him in accordance with it, than it is to test the colour-vision
of pilots and engineers. Moreover, since all ideas
may be translated into words, and since verbal ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
may also be visual, auditory or motor,&mdash;ideas of the
word seen, heard, or spoken,&mdash;three sub-types were
added to the main types of idea; <i>the verbal-visual, the
verbal-auditory, and the verbal-motor</i>. The doctrine of
types found support in pathology; thus, the famous
French physician J. M. Charcot reports a case of eye-mindedness
in which visual ideas were suddenly lost.
The patient writes: “I possessed at one time a great
faculty of picturing to myself persons who interested
me, colours and objects of every kind; I made use of
this faculty extensively in my studies. I read anything
I wanted to learn, and then shutting my eyes I saw
again quite clearly the letters with their every detail.
All of a sudden this internal vision absolutely disappeared.
Now I cannot picture to myself the features of
my children or my wife, or any other object of my daily
surroundings. I dream simply of speech. I am obliged
to <i>say</i> things which I wish to retain in my memory,
whereas formerly it was sufficient for me to photograph
them in my eye.”</p>

<p>Nowadays the case could hardly be recorded in so
simple a way; we have learned that <i>ideational type is a
very complicated and itself a very variable matter</i>. Marked
differences of imagery, as between one mind and another,
undoubtedly exist; but the distribution into types is
made difficult by two facts. The first is that there are
great differences in the nature of images even where the
gross type is the same; thus, of two predominantly eye-minded
persons, the one may have vivid and precise,
the other vague and obscure images. The second is
that imagery varies with the nature of the test made,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the situation or material that arouses the images; in
strictness, we can only say that, under such-and-such
conditions, the imaginal type proved to be such-and-such.
With these cautions before us, we can, however,
make out four common types. The <b>versatile</b> type uses
visual, auditory and verbal-motor images more or less
indifferently. A second type prefers <b>visual</b> images,
with verbal-motor a good second. A third type prefers
<b>verbal images of the auditory-motor kind</b>, with visual
images a poor second. A fourth is almost exclusively
<b>verbal-motor</b>. In this last type, kinæsthesis, in the
special form of the feel of articulation, has reconquered
the place that it held in the long-gone past, before speech
had come (p. 119).</p>

<p>We observe nothing of these differences in daily life,
simply because we are interested in meanings and not in
processes; so long as the audience gets somewhere near
the meaning that the speaker or writer is trying to convey,
everything necessary for practical purposes has been
accomplished. All the same, <i>there are many signs of
ideational type</i>, if we are on the alert to seize them.
The attitude of attention is different, according as a
man’s ideas are visual or auditory-motor; the child’s
mode of recitation is different, slow and systematic in
the former case, quick and impulsive in the latter; the
mistakes made are characteristic; and you can tell by
an author’s style whether he has visual images and
whether he hears his sentences ring in the mind’s ear.
<i>It is natural to connect the dominance of certain images
with the choice of certain professions; but a correlation
cannot be made out.</i> “I should have thought,” remarks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Galton, “that the faculty of visualisation would be
common among geometricians, but many of the highest
seem able somehow to get on without much of it;”
and again “men who declare themselves entirely deficient
in the power of seeing mental pictures can become
painters” of acknowledged rank. The late Professor
James wrote to the same effect: “I am myself a good
draughtsman, and have a very lively interest in pictures,
statues, architecture and decoration. But I am an
extremely poor visualiser.” These statements, to be
sure, were made without any thorough-going investigation;
we must remember that there are different
ways of geometrising as there are different styles and
ideals of painting; and we may add that there are
plenty of instances on the other side; Goethe and
Dickens were magnificent visualisers. The study of
imaginal type, in relation to the interests and achievement
of its possessor, thus offers an inviting field of
work.</p>

<p class="p1">(1) State in your own words, and without looking at the
book, why the psychologist has to do with meaning, and
what meaning is psychologically. Illustrate from your own
experience; find, in particular, a case of meaning carried by
kinæsthesis, and a case of meaning carried in purely nervous
terms.</p>


<p>(2) Draw diagrams to illustrate the typical perception
and idea, and the various stages in its reduction to the skeleton-type
described at the end of § 24.</p>


<p>(3) Qualitative perceptions undergo relatively little change.
What changes have they undergone? How is it that these
changes have not unfitted them to mean quality?</p>


<p>(4) A stereoscope and a set of slides prepared by the author
may be obtained from the C. H. Stoelting Co., 3047 Carroll
Avenue, Chicago, Ill. Explain the construction of the
stereoscope, part by part; and work carefully through the
slides, writing down what you see. It is useless to play with
the instrument; take the experiments seriously.</p>


<p>(5) If you are touched with a pencil on wrist and chest,
and try to retouch the places stimulated, you are more nearly
right on wrist than on chest. Why? Try the experiment
several times over.</p>


<p>(6) You have probably often heard the rising tone of a
siren-whistle sounded by some manufactory or given as a
fire-signal. Can you image it? If so, what is the index of
change? If not, try to lay your finger on this index when you
next hear the whistle.</p>


<p>(7) If tastes and smells have not the attribute of extension,
how do you account for their apparent spread in space?
If sounds are not spatial, how is it that we can localise them?</p>


<p>(8) Is there such a thing as a purely visual rhythm? How
would you approach the question experimentally?</p>


<p>(9) Perform Aristotle’s experiment, by crossing the second

statement correct? Write out your observations. (<i>b</i>) Is
sight decisive? Helmholtz said, on the contrary: “We
are continually controlling and correcting the notions of

<p>(10) Can you suggest methods for the determination of
imaginal type?</p>


<p>(11) Close your eyes, (<i>a</i>) Let an experimenter draw a
blunt-pointed pencil <i>at an even rate</i> along the inside of your
arm from the shoulder to the tip of the middle finger. The
point seems to travel more quickly at some places than
at others: why? Draw a diagram of the arm, and mark the
places of apparent slowing and quickening. (<i>b</i>) Tie two
pencils together with a bit of rubber between, so that the
points are 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 in. apart. Let an experimenter set the
two points crosswise on the skin at the shoulder, and draw
them with even speed and pressure along the inside of your
arm to the finger-tips. The points seem to converge and diverge:
why? Draw a diagram as before.</p>

<p>§ 31. <b>The Association of Ideas.</b>&mdash;The doctrine of the
‘association of ideas’ is one of the oldest and most
influential in the history of psychology. It begins, in a
somewhat casual way, with Aristotle. Suppose, Aristotle
says, that we are trying to recall something that
has slipped our mind; what do we ordinarily do? We
hunt through a number of things, beginning with something
that is like what we want to recall, or contrary
to it, or that was next it in time, or adjacent to it in space.
These other things, the like, the contrary, the just before
or just after, the adjoining, have the power to suggest
what we have forgotten. Aristotle gives the
impression that everybody acts in this way, as a matter
of course; and no doubt his hearers acquiesced; for the
statement sounds reasonable. We want, for instance,
to remember a certain picture that we saw ten years
ago: how do we set to work? We start from something
like it: ‘I remember that it reminded me of Van Eyck’;
or from something opposite: ‘I remember smiling to
think how a Venetian would have treated it’; or from
something next it in time: ‘I remember coming to it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
after three whole hours of Dutch <i>genre</i>’; or from something
next it in space: ‘I remember that it hung
beside a Mabuse portrait.’ Seeing how natural and
obvious such remarks are, we can understand that
Aristotle’s single sentence had tremendous consequences
for psychology. It foreshadowed the four ‘laws of
the association of ideas,’ <i>the laws of similarity, of contrast,
of succession in time, and of coexistence in space</i>.
According to the doctrine of association, one idea ‘calls
up’ another <i>because</i> it is like that other, or contrasts
with it, or was next to it in time or space; likeness and
difference, succession and adjacency, somehow give an
idea the power to recall, and render it liable in its turn
to be recalled. The four laws thus represent an attempt
to <i>explain</i> the course of our ideas, and for that reason
they have always appealed to common sense.</p>

<p>But, for the same reason, the laws have not proved
an unmixed blessing to psychology. Aristotle, it is
clear, was simply raising a practical question; and practical
questions are answered in terms of meaning, not
of process. Moreover, Aristotle was temperamentally
a logician, and he could not help throwing even this bit
of everyday practice into formal logical shape. Notice
the arrangement in pairs: like-contrary, coexistent-successive;
that is logical. Notice also the nature of
the pairs. Like-contrary is the extreme way of saying
like-unlike; and when you mention succession, you
mention the only kind of non-coexistence that can
come into account for psychology; so that both pairs
have the form ‘A and not-A’ (like and not-like, coexistent
and not-coexistent); and that is logical again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
<i>Aristotle’s four rules are therefore not really empirical</i>,
in the sense that they are directly derived from a study
of experience; they rather show the inveterate logician,
who is bound to schematise and tabulate. Later writers,
swayed now by experience and now by logic, have both
increased and decreased the number of these ‘laws’ of
association; <i>the general tendency has been to reduce them
to two, or even to one</i>. Thus, we can make contrast, logically,
a case of likeness; the palace reminds us of the
hovel, apparently by contrast; yet are not the palace
and the hovel alike, as human habitations? We can,
still more easily, reduce space to time. If the two
pictures hung together on the wall, they were seen at
the same time. Simultaneity, however, is one kind of
contiguity in time; succession is another; and temporal
contiguity thus includes everything. The four laws
have become two: <i>similarity, and contiguity in time</i>.</p>

<p>Can we go further? Yes, if we go on arguing. The
picture reminded me of Van Eyck; it was <i>like</i> a Van
Eyck; the association seems to be an association by
similarity. Yet it is practically certain that the picture
in question was, at some time or other, present in my
mind <i>along with</i> some picture by Van Eyck. It is practically
certain, in other words, that the two ideas were
in temporal contiguity; and every instance of association
by similarity raises the same sort of presumption.
That being the case, we may discard the law of similarity;
and <b>contiguity</b> stands alone, the sole survivor of the
Aristotelian quartet. Only, <b>this is all logic</b>, a matter of
meanings, a translation of psychological fact; we have
not got to the facts themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>We shall come to psychology presently. Meantime
<i>you should try to realise how well this doctrine of association
works for practical purposes, and how strong is the
appeal it makes to the practical side of our nature</i>. It
explains the appearance of every single idea that has
ever occurred to anybody; it offers to take us to the
very heart of psychology without need of training or
preparation; it flatters us into the belief that we have
all our lives been talking and thinking psychology without
knowing it; it covers up the gap that separates
common sense from science. Small wonder that Hume
compared the law of association in psychology with
the law of gravitation in physics! All the great names
in British psychology (and the fact throws a good deal
of light on the psychology of the nation itself) are connected
with the doctrine of association; a whole science
has taken its national colour from a single principle of
explanation. Association has also played its part,
though less dominantly, in France and Germany.</p>

<p>Realise all this; and realise also that the doctrine
was of great service in the days when psychology was
in the making; it is not only agreeable to common sense,
it is not only historically important, but it also <i>did true
psychological service</i>. Let us admit all this: and then
we must add that <i>the reign of associationism was over
as soon as ever psychology became scientific</i>; as soon,
that is, as the proper task of psychology was recognised
and formulated (p. 18). For let us take an instance:
what does the word ‘summer’ suggest to you? Very
likely it suggests ‘winter.’ How, then, is this association
to be explained psychologically? By contrast? But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the ideas of summer and winter may be exactly alike,
both of them verbal-auditory-motor, or both of them
mental pictures; the contrast is a contrast of meaning,
not of mental process or pattern; the real summer, what
we mean by the word ‘summer,’ contrasts with the real
winter, and not the idea of summer with the idea of
winter. By resemblance? But, if the ideas of summer
and winter are exactly alike, so are they also like thousands
of other ideas, verbal-auditory-motor or visual-imaginal;
there is no reason in their psychological
likeness why the one should suggest the other; and if
they do suggest each other by ‘resemblance,’ the resemblance
is again a likeness of meaning (they are both
seasons of the year) and not of mental constitution.
Try the matter out for yourself, in any concrete case of
association, and you will reach the same result; the
ideas of associationism are not psychological ideas.
James sums things up for us: “Association,” he
says, “so far as the word stands for an <i>effect</i>, is between
<i>things thought of</i>; it is things, not ideas, which are associated
in the mind. And so far as association stands for
a <i>cause</i>, it is between <i>processes in the brain</i>; it is these
which, by being associated in certain ways, determine
what successive objects shall be thought.” <b>The brain
associates, and meanings are associated.</b> We have
already said something of the psychology of meaning
(pp. 26 ff., 117 ff.); what can we now say of the associative
functions of the brain?</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c149" id="c149">§ 32</a>. <b>Associative Tendencies: Material of Study.</b>&mdash;We
want to find out how those processes in the brain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
which are the correlates of our ideas go together, get
connected or associated. The brain is a machine;
and it is not only complicated, but it is also plastic,
that is, it is subject to change and modification. The
<i>complexity</i> of the machine makes it necessary for us to
work with simple stimuli and by strict methods; only
if we work with simple stimuli shall we get to the bare
essentials of the associative functions; and only if we
work by strict methods shall we obtain results which
other investigators can repeat and verify. Even so,
the <i>plasticity</i> of the machine makes it impossible for us
to lay down hard and fast laws of connection; we can
speak only of connective tendencies or of <b>associative
tendencies</b>; what actually happens, in any particular
case, is likely to be the joint result of many tendencies,
weak and strong, conflicting and concurring.</p>

<p>The task before us is, therefore, not easy; but it is
straightforward; and that is the next best thing. We
want to find out how associative tendencies in the brain
are set up; and to do this we must, evidently, find some
way of <i>creating</i> a bond between one nervous process
and another; we must devise experiments in which we
<i>make</i> or <i>construct</i> brain-connections. We need not look
far afield; for we make such connections whenever we
<b>learn</b> anything new; so that we have only to learn under
experimental conditions, and the task is accomplished.
But what shall we learn? what stimuli shall we employ
in the experiments? ‘Words,’ you will say; and words
have many advantages for learning; but they have,
in this case, the supreme disadvantage that they are
ingrained meanings. Words therefore will not do;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
but something very like them will. The question of the
stimuli to be employed was, in fact, answered for us,
thirty years ago, by the German psychologist Hermann
Ebbinghaus, who&mdash;by one of those happy thoughts
that come after long and intensive occupation with a
subject&mdash;hit upon the notion of the <b>meaningless syllable</b>.
Ebbinghaus made up over 2000 meaningless
‘words,’ all consisting of a vowel or diphthong between
two consonants; syllables standing in the same relation
to his own language that leb, rit, mon, yup, kig, wes,
der, zam, for instance, bear to English. See the advantage
of this kind of material for the work we have in
view! The syllables are just like words, in that they
may be seen, heard, or felt in the throat; they are unlike
words, and vastly superior to them, in that they
have no habitual associates; they lack context and meaning;
every syllable in a series may be considered to
have the same chances of making connections as every
other. The material is so rich and varied that endless
experiments can be made; it is so simple and uniform
that the results of one experiment may be compared
directly with the results of another; it may be drawn
from any language, and so may be used in the laboratories
of any country. Moreover, it is absolutely
under control; it is just the kind of material that we
need when we are tied down to strict and accurate
method; we can vary at will the manner of presentation
to the learner, the number of syllables in a series, the
rate at which they follow one another, and so on; and
the report required from the learner himself is easy and
natural; there are no long descriptive phrases; he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
only to say or to write the syllables he has learned.
Lastly, <i>we may proceed from experiments with this meaningless
material to experiments with real words</i>, words that
mean; and we may hope in that way to pass beyond
the bare essentials of the brain’s associative function,
and to get a clue to the complex interplay of associative
tendencies in real life. All in all, it is not too
much to say that Ebbinghaus’ recourse to meaningless
syllables, as means to the study of associative tendencies,
marks the most considerable advance, in this
chapter of the psychological system, since the time of
Aristotle.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c152" id="c152">§ 33</a>. <b>The Establishment of Associative Tendencies.</b>&mdash;The
use of <b>meaningless syllables</b> has brought with it
a whole armoury of technical methods for the study of
the associative tendencies. We have here no space to
treat of these methods in detail; fortunately, the results
that we shall mention speak for themselves; and it
may be added that all the methods of experiment are,
in principle, changes rung upon one simple model, in
which the observer sits down before a series of syllables,
reads them through, so-many times over, in a state of
attention, and then, either immediately or after an
interval of time, repeats them ‘from memory.’ We
proceed, then, to answer the question: How are associative
tendencies established in the brain?</p>

<p>Their establishment depends, first and most obviously,
upon the <i>number of syllables</i> in the series presented to
the observer. While he can recite correctly, after a
single reading, a series of 6 or 7, a longer series simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
throws him into confusion. The first and last terms
have a definite advantage; they may, indeed, be the
only syllables that can be repeated after a single reading
of a 12-term series. Secondly, the tendencies are
strengthened by <i>repetition</i>. The first reading is more
important than any other single reading; after that,
there is for a while little if any improvement; then the
results take a sudden step up; and thenceforward
progress is fairly steady until the limit of the experiment
is reached. Thirdly, the tendencies are furthered
by a <i>grouping</i> of the syllables. The observer learns a
series more quickly if, for instance, he throws it into a
rhythm. Fourthly, it is important to <i>distribute</i> the
readings in time. Two readings a day for 12 days give
better results than four a day for 6 days, or eight a day
for 3 days, although the total number remains the same.
Fifthly, the <i>rate</i> of reading has its effect; the syllables
must not follow one another too fast or too slowly.
There are great differences between individual learners;
but we may say in general that the syllables should at
first be presented at a moderate rate (perhaps two in
the second), and that the rate should be slowly increased
as the readings proceed. Sixthly, not only repetition
itself, but also the <i>manner of repetition</i>, makes a
difference. Meaningless syllables are learned somewhat
better if the whole series is read through, over
and over, from end to end, than if they are taken a
few at a time, in small lots. Lastly, <i>recitation</i> or reading
aloud is ordinarily more effective than silent reading;
largely, perhaps, because the separate pronouncing of
every syllable equalises attention; every term of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
series is brought out sharply and clearly, and there is
no chance to slur.</p>

<p>Here, however, we must remember the differences
of imaginal type (p. 138); and it is true that a markedly
visual learner will profit less by recitation than an
auditory-motor learner. These experiments have, indeed,
revealed other typical differences between individuals,
such as those of <i>slow and quick</i>, and of <i>receptive
and ingenious</i> learning. Some of us, it seems, are naturally
quick, and some are naturally slow learners, just
as some work best at night and others in the morning.
Some observers, again, accept the series of syllables,
passively and without question; others embroider and
interpret the meaningless forms in all manner of ways;
<i>mon</i> becomes man, and <i>kig</i> king, and <i>wer</i> where, and so
on. We know nothing at present of the correlated differences
in the nervous system.</p>

<p>The results just given may be compared with those
obtained when <b>meaningful stimuli</b> are employed. Thus,
8 or 9 one-syllable words, and 10 to 12 one-place numbers,
can be recited after a single reading. Meaningful
material, which is grouped or unified by its topic, may
be learned ten times as quickly as meaningless syllables.
It may also be presented more rapidly; iambic and
trochaic verses, for instances, may be taken at double
the rate of the syllables. Dates of historical events,
and the words of a foreign language, are best learned
like the meaningless syllables; and connected meaningful
material, like a poem or an oration, should very
decidedly be read as a whole, from end to end, in the
successive repetitions. If there are brief passages of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
unusual difficulty, they may, of course, be gone over by
themselves, in the intervals between the total readings;
the general rule, however, is to learn by wholes. This
appears, in fact, to be the procedure generally followed
by bards and tellers of folktales; and actors who play
many rôles in quick succession are able to ‘wing a part,’
as the phrase goes, by reading it through several times
over at brief intervals. Children who memorise a
poem in sections, a stanza now and a stanza to-morrow,
waste a great deal of time.</p>

<p>Let us now come back to the <b>meaningless syllables</b>,
and ask what is <i>the net result of all the influences</i> that we
have listed. Suppose, in other words, that a series of
syllables has been presented at a certain rate, thrown
into a certain rhythm, repeated a certain number of
times with fitting distribution in time, recited at every
repetition: what is the final outcome, as regards the
establishment of associative tendencies in the brain?
It is this: <i>that a strong connection has been set up between
the successive terms of the series, in the order of their
presentation; and that weaker connections have been set
up between every term and every other term, whether the
terms are near or remote in the series, and whether they
are taken forwards or backwards</i>. Let us illustrate by
reference to the alphabet. If the alphabet represents
a series of meaningless syllables, then there is a strong
connection between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, ... <i>y</i> and <i>z</i>;
but there are also weaker connections between <i>a</i> and <i>d</i>,
... <i>v</i> and <i>z</i>; and further, there are connections backward
between <i>z</i> and <i>y</i>, <i>z</i> and <i>x</i>, ... <i>d</i> and <i>a</i>. The
series of syllables has thus impressed the brain with <i>a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
very complex meshwork of associative tendencies</i>, stronger
in some places (direct forward connection) and weaker
in others (remote and backward connection), but still
functionally interconnected through all its parts.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c156" id="c156">§ 34</a>. <b>The Interference and Decay of Associative
Tendencies.</b>&mdash;If a set of associative tendencies, such
as we have just described, is left to itself, and neither
disturbed nor renewed, it <i>gradually disappears</i>; the loss
is at first very rapid, then proceeds more slowly, and
thereafter goes on only at a snail’s pace. To make the
matter concrete, we may think of the meshwork of
tendencies as a meshwork of channels, deeper and shallower,
in the substance of the brain; then the rule is
that the channels tend to fill up,&mdash;the shallow ones
speedily, the deeper ones at first quickly and then more
and more slowly,&mdash;until everything is smooth again.
This is a mere figure, but it carries the meaning that we
desire. The same thing happens with <i>the tendencies set
up by meaningful material</i>; they too slowly die away;
but <i>it is doubtful if they ever wholly disappear</i>; in their
case the brain, if it has been thoroughly impressed,
seems never wholly to ‘forget.’ Ebbinghaus learned
some stanzas of Byron’s Don Juan, for experimental
purposes, and did not look at them again for 22 years;
yet he relearned those stanzas in 93 per cent. of the time
required to learn new stanzas; a saving of 7 per cent.
Some stanzas that he had learned more thoroughly were
not read again for 17 years; these were relearned with a
saving of nearly 20 per cent. He had no memory whatever
of the verses formerly learned; but his brain ‘remembered’;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the associative tendencies had not completely
disappeared.</p>

<p>As a rule, however, a particular set of tendencies is
not allowed to die a natural death; it is interfered with
by others. <i>All associative tendencies need a certain
time to establish themselves</i>, to settle down; and if this
time is not granted, but stimulus treads on the heels of
stimulus, there is no impression of the meshwork, and
no connections are formed; we have seen that a series
of excessive length simply throws the learner into confusion.
A recently acquired connection may even be
abolished, as most of us know to our cost, by interruption
of the train of thought; you have just got to your
point, to the insight, the phrasing, the argument, that
will clinch things; you are distracted by some irrelevant
matter; and when you come back to your work, the
point has gone. So nicely balanced and so easily disturbed
are the associative tendencies, that you may
never recover it; no wonder that the constructive worker,
in literature, in science, in affairs, ‘hates to be interrupted’!</p>

<p>With meaningful material, interference may arise in
other ways. Take the alphabet again; <i>a</i> is connected
with <i>b</i> through the frequent repetition of <i>abc</i>, but is also
connected with <i>z</i> by the phrase ‘<i>a</i> to <i>z</i>.’ If, then, <i>a</i>
appears; and if the <i>b</i>-tendency and the <i>z</i>-tendency are
of approximately equal strength; then there may be no
connection at all; the two tendencies cancel or inhibit
each other. A question may leave you dumb, not because
you have no answer, but because you have so
many different answers that no one of them can force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
through to expression. This sort of interference,
which comes at the end of the associative process, is
called <b>terminal inhibition</b>; there is another kind, coming
at the beginning of the process, which we may call
<b>initial inhibition</b>. If <i>a</i> is already connected with <i>b</i>, then
it is difficult to connect it with <i>k</i>; <i>b</i> gets in the way. You
have some particular fault of style, or you have fallen
into the habit of spelling wrongly some particular word;
you want to correct the fault, to spell aright. But
every time that you are off guard, the mistake recurs;
the existing connection <i>a-b</i> heads off the desired connection
<i>a-k</i>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are compensations. If a group
of tendencies, for instance, does escape interference,
then <i>the brain settles down of itself</i>. Schoolboys, with
a keen sense for economy of effort, learn their lessons
only partway overnight, and find that a hasty review
next morning is enough to fix them; the associative
tendencies work while their owners sleep. The practised
speaker, knowing that he has to talk on a certain
subject at a certain date, marshals his present ideas in
half-an-hour of concentrated attention, and then drops
the whole thing; his brain incubates it for him; and
when the appointed day comes near, he finds that his
associative tendencies have practically prepared his
address. Besides, the tendencies may converge, as
well as interfere; we have seen how continued attention
opens the mind to relevant facts and closes it against the
irrelevant (p. 98). If they did not, it would be impossible
for us to follow the thread of a paragraph, to say
nothing of a chapter or of a whole book. <b>Convergence</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
thus offsets interference. We shall meet it in various
forms later (§§ 42, 45, 65); meantime we leave the brain,
and pass to the mental processes themselves. How
are they connected?</p>


<p class="p2"><a name="c159" id="c159">§ 35</a>. <b>The Connections of Mental Processes.</b>&mdash;So
far as the elementary processes are concerned, this
question has already been answered in our discussion
of perception. We found that there were <i>two modes of
sensory connection</i>, two ways in which sensations may go
together. In qualitative perceptions, such as the perception
of a musical note, there is a blend or <b>fusion</b> of
qualities; we can, to be sure, analyse the compound
tone, after practice, into fundamental and overtones;
yet it still comes to us as unitary, as a single impression;
it stands only at one remove, so to speak, from the
simplicity of sensation itself. The tastes of coffee and
lemonade, with their blending of taste and smell, of
touch and temperature; the organic feels of hunger and
thirst and nausea; the kinæsthesis aroused by grasping
and pulling, by lifting the arm and swinging the foot;
all these experiences are fusions, more or less intimate,
more or less complex, of sensory qualities. They too
can be analysed; but the analysis is not easy; the
qualities cling together, seem in a way to merge into one
another. In spatial perceptions, on the other hand, in
such perceptions as the sight of my desk with its litter
of writing materials, the elementary processes stand out
side by side; brown contrasts with blue, dark with light;
here, we might say, is no confluence, but rather concourse.
In the perception of rhythm we have the same separateness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of sensations, only that it is now temporal instead
of spatial; and in the perception of change (p. 132)
we find both modes of connection, separate qualities or
intensities passing into one another by that peculiar
blur or fusion which we have called the index of change.
This second type of connection, whether it is the side-by-side
of space or the end-to-end of time, may be
named <b>conjunction</b>.</p>

<p>The associative tendencies which we have been more
recently discussing are set up by series of meaningless
syllables, that is to say, by discrete stimuli. It is clear,
then, that the connection of the correlated mental processes
is of the conjunctive type; we have said nothing
of the brain-processes which underlie sensory fusion.
We can, indeed, say nothing of them; we have no knowledge
of their nature. It has been suggested that qualitative
perception is correlated with a <i>synergy</i> of the
brain-processes, that is, with a cooperation so close
that every process taking part in it loses something of
its individuality. That is possible; we cannot say
more.</p>

<p>When we leave the elementary processes for <i>complex
experiences</i>, for perceptions and ideas, and ask how these
are connected, we cannot return any completely satisfactory
answer. Experiments may be made; thus, a
familiar visual stimulus (word or simple picture) may
be shown for a few seconds to the observer, with the instruction
that he receive it passively and report the consequent
course of his mental processes. Under these
circumstances, it invariably happens that the stimulus
is immediately named. After that, apparently, any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of <i>three typical things may happen</i>. First, the named
perception is supplemented by a sense-feeling. A word
printed in very small letters on a large background
aroused the feeling of loneliness; a word printed in
red, a feeling of excitement; the word ‘blinding,’ the
disagreeable feeling of a dazzling light. Then the feeling
gives way to an idea, which supplants the meaning
of the stimulus. Secondly, the named perception is
resolved into the idea of some object previously seen.
An outline drawing of a face may be replaced by the
idea of a friend, whose features are, so to say, read into
the drawing; or the word ‘Tell,’ printed on a blue
ground, may be replaced by the idea of the familiar picture
of William Tell springing from a boat to the rocks;
the blue of the background becomes the blue sky of
the painting. Thirdly, and only occasionally, the
named perception is followed by an idea which comes
separate and detached; we have the traditional pattern
of the ‘successive association.’ These three types of
connection (there are, of course, intermediate forms) do
not furnish a satisfactory answer to our question,
mainly because the experiments are not properly under
control; the observer comes to them with all sorts of
associative tendencies at work; and unless we make a
very large number of observations, we cannot be sure
that our results are either representative or exhaustive.</p>

<p>At the same time, such experiments help us; they
show, for instance, that the doctrine of association&mdash;quite
apart from its logical leanings, or perhaps just by
reason of them&mdash;regarded the course of ideas in too
‘intellectual’ a way; <i>the sense-feelings, and other feeling-blends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
that we shall mention later, play a larger part in
our thinking than the associationists dreamed of</i>. They
show, too, that <i>the ‘successive association’ is not the
commonest, but rather the least common, form of mental
connection</i>. Listen to a quotation from Hobbes! “In
a discourse of our present civil war,” he writes, “what
could seem more impertinent [less to the point] than to
ask, as one did, what was the value of the Roman
penny? Yet the coherence to me was manifest enough.
For the thought of the war introduced the thought of
delivering up the king to his enemies; the thought of
that brought in the thought of the delivering up of
Christ; and that again the thought of the thirty pence,
which was the price of that treason. And thence easily
followed that malicious question: and all this in a moment
of time, for thought is quick.” Hobbes has worked
out the logical coherence, the coherence of meaning; but
he is very far from a psychology of the situation. What
actually took place in the mind of the questioner we
shall never know; we may be very sure, however, that
his mental processes did not follow one another in
logical order, as Hobbes imagines. There was a convergence
of associative tendencies, which expressed
itself in the question; there need not have been any
succession of ideas at all.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c162" id="c162">§ 36</a>. <b>The Law of Mental Connection.</b>&mdash;We have
spoken at some length of the establishment of associative
tendencies in the brain, of their decay with time,
and of their mutual interference. Can we sum up our
knowledge of them in <i>a single general statement</i>? And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
can we then translate this general statement into <b>psychological</b>
language, and so reach a <i>formula of mental
connection</i> that may stand in place of the logical laws
of association? Let us try.</p>

<p>We must proceed very carefully, even if our care
drives us into clumsiness of expression. We cannot, for
instance, leave out the fact that the meaningless syllables
are given in the state of <i>attention</i>. It appears,
indeed, that attention is necessary to association; we
may doubt if any amount of repetition&mdash;to take that
example&mdash;would set up an associative tendency, were
it not for attention. Repetition, we remember, is one
of the determinants of attention (p. 94); so that the
repeated experience is likely to become vivid in the very
nature of the case; but if it does not, if for any reason
our attention is diverted or we fail to notice the stimulus,
repetition has no associative power. How many of us
would like to recall the carpet or wall-paper of the room
we slept in as children! Thousands of times we saw
the colours and the patterns; but our adult memory is
an absolute blank; those repeated stimuli never ‘impressed’
us.</p>

<p>We cannot either leave out the fact that the meaningless
syllables are bracketed all together, so to speak,
by a certain <i>situation</i>, namely, the situation created by
the experiment. The observer comes to them, in accordance
with this situation, intending to learn them,
to memorise them: a fact of very great importance!&mdash;and
a fact that needs to be dwelt on for a little, if we
are to see our way clearly in what follows. We said
on p. 149 that <i>meanings</i> are associated. Yet we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
been studying the formation of associative tendencies
in the brain, the associating organ, by the help of&mdash;meaningless
syllables! Is there not a flat contradiction
here between theory and practice? No, that is
really not the case; and the key to the riddle lies in this
fact of the ‘situation’ which we are now discussing.
The syllables are meaningless <i>as</i> syllables; they are
thus set apart from ordinary syllables that are meaningful;
and it is this difference from <i>words</i>, combined
with their likeness to words in other respects, that makes
them useful to the experimenter (p. 151). For since they
are themselves meaningless, we can put upon them a
constant meaning of our own; we can introduce them
into any situation of our own making; and the meaning
that we give them, in the study of the associative tendencies,
is the meaning of ‘an experimental series to be
learned under certain instructions’: a meaning which
is definite, and which remains the same throughout the
experiments. You see, then, that the ‘situation’ is
important.</p>

<p>Attention, as we know, means reinforcement of certain
nervous processes and inhibition of others (p. 107);
and the intention to learn implies the activity of directive
nerve-forces (p. 96), the existence of a special set
or disposition of the brain. Let us keep these things
in mind; and let us call the brain-processes that are
correlated with mental processes ‘psychoneural’ processes.
Then we may say: <i>When a number of psychoneural
processes, all of which are reinforced and all of which
stand alike under the directive influence of a nervous disposition,
occur together under certain favourable conditions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
then</i> <b>associative tendencies</b> <i>are established among them,
such that the recurrence of any one tends to involve, according
to circumstances, the recurrence of the others</i>. The
phrase ‘under favourable conditions’ refers to the effect
of repetition of the series, of their distribution in time,
and so forth; and the phrase ‘according to circumstances’
means that heed must be paid to the lapse of
time since learning, to the working of initial or terminal
inhibition, and so forth.</p>

<p>So much for a generalised law of associative tendency,
derived from the work with meaningless syllables! That
is <i>a law of nervous action</i>; now let us turn to <b>psychology</b>,
and see if we can formulate a law of mental connection.
We shall be dealing with perceptions and ideas; and
we shall be dealing with them as experiences, made up
of core and context (p. 117).</p>

<p><i>Attention</i> is again necessary. Intention, on the
other hand, seems not to be necessary; there need be
no special purpose behind the experiences, as the intention
to learn is behind the experiments with meaningless
syllables; attention is enough. The idea of a
surgical operation, for instance, may be permanently
connected with the idea of the surgeon who performed
it, although the intervention of that particular surgeon
was quite casual and unexpected. The reason is that
<i>attention brings a situation, its own situation, with it</i>;
the determinants of primary attention are, as we put
it on p. 97, the ‘great biological stimuli,’ things that
an organism <i>must</i> take notice of, if it is to persist as a
living organism at all; and the determinants of derived
primary attention are also what we may call ‘situational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>’
affairs, things that appeal in certain circumstances to
certain sides of our nature, things that interest or ‘impress’
us. So attention, too, implies a set or disposition
of the nervous system; common sense is so far in the right&mdash;though
its words are misleading&mdash;when it talks of a
‘concentration of the mind,’ of ‘pulling oneself together,’
and the like; and <i>this general set is sufficient</i>, without the
presence of a distinct purpose. Our law will read, then,
somewhat to this effect: <i>If a number of vivid perceptions
or ideas, whose situational context is the same, occur together
under favourable conditions, then the later appearance
in the same situational context of any one will tend
to be accompanied, according to circumstances, by the
reappearance (as ideas) of the others</i>.</p>

<p>That is correct, so far as it goes; though, as we shall
see in a moment, it does not go quite far enough. Meanwhile,
you must clearly realise that <i>the processes which
compose the perceptions and ideas are extremely variable</i>.
We have already discussed this matter; we have seen
that the perception of an object and the idea of the same
object do not by any means correspond, term for term,
like original and copy; the form of our ideas depends,
in the first instance, upon our imaginal type, and secondarily
upon the special circumstances under which they
appear (pp. 139 f.). When, therefore, we speak of ‘the
later appearance of an idea in the same situational
context,’ we really mean the appearance of that complex
of mental processes which, under the law of imaginal
type and under the special circumstances of the
moment, has taken the place of the original complex.
In the next chapter we shall be discussing the ‘memory-image,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>’
and you will then be shown how radically an
idea may be transformed; so radically, that it may be
likened rather to a translation than a copy of the perception,
rather to a rendering into another language
than a reproduction. If you want a catch-phrase, to
hold this fact of change in mind, <i>think of association as
a marriage by proxy</i>; the marriage-bond, the situational
context, remains the same, but the parties are represented
by very variable mental complexes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
     <img src="images/ill-167.jpg" width="500" height="136"
         alt=""
         title="" />
</div>

<p>Now for the law once more! <i>The formula does not
go far enough; for while it covers the movement of ideas
within a single situational context, it does not show how
we may pass, as we undoubtedly do, from one situational
context to another.</i> Here a diagram will, perhaps, make
things plain. Suppose that we start out with an idea
<i>a</i>, composed of core and context, and lying within the
wider situational context of the right-hand oval. The
appearance of <i>a</i> is followed, let us assume, by the reappearance
of <i>b</i>, which lies within the same situational
context. The idea <i>b</i> may be followed, in its turn, by <i>c</i>.
But since <i>b</i> belongs also to a second situation, represented
by the left-hand oval, it may be followed instead
by the idea <i>x</i>; and in that event we shall have travelled
from the one situational context to the other. Whether
<i>c</i> or <i>x</i> comes up is a matter which depends entirely upon
the relative strength of the associative tendencies at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the moment. The diagram, it is needless to say, is
immensely over-simplified; we have placed <i>a</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>x</i>
within <i>one</i> situational context only, and we have made
the ideas <i>follow</i> one another in single file; but it shows
how our formulation of the law must be extended, if we
are to ‘get in’ all the facts. We must add: <i>If certain
of these reappearing ideas belong also to a different situational
context, they will tend to be accompanied, again
according to circumstances, by the ideas which formerly
occurred together (as perceptions or ideas) within that
context</i>. In point of fact, most ideas belong to very
many different situations, so that the interweaving of
the associative tendencies may be highly complicated.</p>

<p>These paragraphs will strike you as both difficult and
clumsy; but, if you review the course of the whole
chapter, you will perhaps agree that our attempt at
formulation has been worth while. We began with
Aristotle’s four rules, and found that they are logical
and practical, and also that they may logically be reduced
to one, the ‘law of association by contiguity.’
That law did not satisfy us; we agreed with James that
the <i>brain</i> associates and that <i>meanings</i> are associated.
So we went to the brain; and by the aid of meaningless
syllables we traced the history of the associative tendencies.
Coming back to psychology proper, we distinguished
the fusion and the conjunction of mental
processes, and noted that the experimental method does
not yet permit us to follow the patterns of mental connection
in the large; though the experiments already
made furnish additional proof that the old ‘laws’ of
association are psychologically valueless. Now, to conclude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
we have sought, first, to bring all that we know
of the associative tendencies under a single formula;
and then, building upon that formula and upon our
partial knowledge of the patterns of mental connection,
to write a psychological law that shall replace the logical
law of contiguity. We have had to safeguard and
qualify, and to leave loose ends for individual variation;
but at any rate we have something positive whereby
to support our criticism of the doctrine of association.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c169" id="c169">§ 37</a>. <b>Practice, Habit, Fatigue.</b>&mdash;The establishment
of an associative tendency may be looked upon as the
establishment of a <i>habit</i> of brain-function; the learning
of series of syllables improves with <i>practice</i>; and continued
learning gives rise to <i>fatigue</i>. It is natural,
therefore, that we should here pause to say something
about these three things in their relation to psychology.</p>

<p>All <b>practice</b> begins in the state of <i>attention</i>; but practice,
once started, may go on when attention is distracted
from the matter in hand. We give a great deal of attention
to our first finger-exercises on the piano; presently,
if we have continued them long enough, we may practise
Chopin on the clavier while we are reading a book
or thinking out a problem; the fingers do the practising
for themselves. If we follow <i>the course of practice</i>, from
day to day, we find that improvement is not steady;
we gain very quickly at first, then come to a point at
which we remain stationary for a while, then make
another and slower gain, then rest at a second plateau or
level of practice, and so on. It is doubtful, however,
whether this stepwise advance is characteristic of practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
itself, that is, of the nervous change produced by
repeated stimulation of the same nerve-elements; it
seems rather to be due to changes in our method of
working, to the sudden discovery of some new trick of
procedure, or the sudden release from some hampering
peculiarity of method. We cannot speak in positive
terms since, unfortunately for psychology, the investigators
of practice have been more concerned with outward
results and practical value than with description
of the correlated mental processes.</p>

<p>In psychological experiments, <i>the practised observer
has a threefold superiority over the unpractised</i>: his attitude
to the stimuli, in successive observations, is more
nearly uniform; his attention is sustained at a higher
level; and his discrimination is more refined. This
means that the focal mental processes are few in number;
that they are extremely vivid; and that they are protected,
by strong inhibitory forces, against intrusion
from the outside. It is clear therefore that practice
is very desirable; but it is clear also that experimental
results may be compared only if the stage of practice
at which they are obtained is the same. This rule has
some odd examples: an observer, for instance, who is
practised in the discrimination of lifted weights grows
physically stronger with his practice, and may therefore
judge quite differently from the unpractised observer.</p>

<p><b>Habit</b> is, in general, the outcome of practice; if practice
shows us a nervous set or disposition in the making,
habit is the set taken, the disposition established; the
plastic organ has hardened in some special way. Like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
practice, habit in its early stages requires <i>attention</i>; but
it is to be noticed that a habit may be formed, not only
by the repetition that practice brings, but also by any
single stimulus that violently impresses the nervous
system; the plastic mechanism may be thrown, by a
sudden wrench, into a new and permanent arrangement;
just as we may give a permanent bend to a fencing foil by
a single violent lunge. We have already seen, in our discussion
of the development of attention (p. 99), that
habits already formed are the basis of new acquisition;
and we may remark in passing that the moral and practical
importance of habit has often been written upon
and can hardly be overestimated.</p>

<p>In all experimental work of a serial kind, habit shows
itself as a <i>tendency to experience and report the same things</i>.
Suppose, for example, that we wish to ascertain the least
perceptible difference of tonal pitch. We begin with
two identical tones, and gradually separate them in the
successive experiments of the series. The observer
begins with the experience and report of ‘same’ or
‘alike.’ If, now, the differences between the tones are
made very small, so that the series of observations is
long drawn out, the observer may get into the habit of
hearing and reporting ‘same’; although the tonal
difference is definitely perceptible, it nevertheless passes
without notice. The focal processes are here, as they
are in the case of practice, few in number; but they run
their course at a low level of attention; they are intrinsically
obscure, and the report of them simply follows
the line of least resistance. The observer is correspondingly
liable to distraction from the outside; the inhibitory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
protection is weak. Habituation is consequently
to be avoided, as practice is to be desired.</p>

<p><b>Fatigue</b> appears to be due to a sort of blood-poisoning;
waste-products thrown off by the other tissues are
poured into the blood-stream and there accumulate.
It shows itself first of all by way of <i>muscular sensation</i>
(p. 46), and soon becomes a sense-feeling; whereupon
the biological theory of feeling lays hold of it (p. 84),
and bids us stop work because we are suffering harm.
<i>The feeling of fatigue, however, gives no sure evidence that
the capacity of the nervous system is reduced</i>; the biological
theory signally breaks down; not only can we work
effectively, but we often do our best work, after we have
begun to feel tired. We should take our cue to rest
not from the feeling of fatigue, but rather from the impairment
of our work, in quantity and quality, on the
one hand, and from derangement of the great bodily
functions, such as digestion and sleep, on the other.</p>

<p>In psychological experiments, fatigue <i>lowers the level
and lessens the duration of attention</i>, and so, like habituation,
makes against discrimination; unlike habituation,
it tends also to <i>inhibit expression</i>, and thus renders
the observer’s report hesitating and uncertain. It is
characterised, unlike practice and habituation both,
by a special mental complex; a diffused feeling of lassitude
which may be dominated by some local strain or
pain.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we may mention that a great deal of
controversy has centred about the questions <i>whether
special practice has a general or a merely local effect</i>, and
<i>whether general fatigue may be estimated from the results<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of some special and local test</i>. The first question may
be answered in the words of Professor Thorndike:
“One mental function or activity improves others in
so far as and because they are in part identical with it,
because it contains elements common to them. These
identical elements may be in the stuff, the data concerned
in the training, or in the attitude, the method taken with
it.” The second question cannot yet be answered.
We have every reason to think that fatigue is everywhere
and always one and the same state, that mental
and muscular fatigue, for instance, are identical; if we
are mentally fatigued, we get rest neither by a change
of mental work nor by physical exertion. But no single
test or index of the danger-point of fatigue has yet been
discovered.</p>

<p class="p1">(1) Criticise the following statements. (A good plan
would be, first, to go behind the expression to the meaning,
and to make sure of that; then to take up precisely the opposite
position, and see what can be said for it; and then
finally to write your comments on the statements themselves.)
(<i>a</i>) When two elementary brain-processes have been active
together or in immediate succession, one of them, on reoccurring,

<p class="p1">(2) How does the dominance of associationism in British
psychology throw light upon the psychology of the nation
itself?</p>


<p>(3) What sort of service could the doctrine of association
render to psychology?</p>


<p>(4) Can you give specific reasons for the fact that too long
a series of syllables throws the learner into confusion? and
for the advantage that results from distribution of the series
in time?</p>


<p>(5) Do you think that the quick or the slow learner has the
better chance to retain what he has learned? Have you any
evidence?</p>


<p>(6) Associative tendencies decay with time; yet we have
said that the practised speaker drops his speech, and lets
his brain incubate it. Is there not a contradiction here?
Consider the two cases carefully.</p>


<p>(7) Can you give instances, from your own recent experience,
of the working of initial and terminal inhibition?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>


<p>(8) Later writers have added to the four ‘laws’ of Aristotle
(similarity, contrast, succession, coadjacency) various other
laws: means and end, cause and effect, whole and part,
thing and properties, sign and thing signified, and so on.
Can you suggest any reason for these additions? Can you
give an instance under every ‘law,’ and reduce it psychologically
to our own law of association? Try to get real
instances, taken from your own or your friends’ experience.</p>


<p>(9) Trace the connection of mental processes in your own
case as follows. An experimenter prepares a set of simple
pictures, and arranges to show them for 3 sec. by removal
and replacement of a cardboard screen. Sit at a convenient
distance, and let the stimulus have its way with you; report
your mental processes as they come; the experimenter writes
down what you say. Try to give the facts, and not to express
yourself in meanings. Do not be discouraged if the task
seems, at first, to be too difficult.</p>


<p>(10) (<i>a</i>) Can you give any reason why your work might
be unusually good when you are feeling a little tired?
(<i>b</i>) What is the relation of interest to practice?</p>


<p>(11) State, in your own words, what the doctrine of association
professes to do, and what cardinal mistake it falls
into when it tries to do it.</p>


<p>(12) (<i>a</i>) Write out, in common-sense terms, the facts
that the law of mental connection has to translate into
psychological language. Next, write out, in your own words,
the law itself. Now compare your formulation with that of
the text: do they tally? If not, do you understand the
difference? Do not be satisfied to leave any point obscure.
(<i>b</i>) Show that the law of mental connection does justice, as
the older ‘laws’ of association do not, to the facts of § 35.
(<i>c</i>) You often read in fiction of situations whose every detail
makes an indelible impression; you will find one described,
for instance, in Mrs. Deland’s ‘Philip and his Wife,’ ch. xxix.
Is the writer’s psychology sound?</p>

<p class="pch"><span class="smcap">Memory and Imagination</span></p>

<p class="psh">Inventors seem to treasure up in their minds, what they have found
out, after another manner than those do the same things, who have not
this inventive faculty. The former, when they have occasion to produce
their knowledge, are in some measure obliged immediately to investigate
part of what they want. For this they are not equally fit at all times;
so it has often happened, that such as retain things chiefly by means of
a very strong memory, have appeared off hand more expert than the
discoverers themselves.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry Pemberton</span></p>


<p>§ 38. <b>Recognition.</b>&mdash;The working of the associative
tendencies in the brain guarantees the revival of past
experiences; it does not, so far as we have described
it, guarantee that we remember. For <i>memory, in the
psychological sense, implies recognition</i>; the remembered
experience is not only revived, but is also familiar, comes
to us as a bit of our own past history. We must try
to find out what this familiarity is.</p>

<p>Suppose that you are entering a street-car. As you
enter, you run your eyes over the line of faces before
you. The first half-dozen of your fellow-passengers
are strangers; their faces arouse no interest and do not
arrest your gaze. At the end of the car, however, you
see a friend whom you have not met, perhaps, for some
time; you recognise him. Your indifference is suddenly
gone; you call him by name, take a seat at his
side, and begin to talk with him. What has happened?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Something has happened that, if you analyse it, recalls
the first of the three connective patterns discussed
on p. 161. The visual perception of your friend is supplemented
by a <i>verbal idea</i>, his name. Along with the name
comes a peculiar <i>sense-feeling</i>, a feeling that you may
characterise as a glow of warmth, a feeling of intimacy,
a feeling of sociable ease, of relaxation from the formal
manner that you wear with strangers. And hardly
has the feeling formed when <i>ideas</i> of sorts begin to
crowd upon you, and the conversation starts. All this
complexity of mental connection is there, and the whole
experience may be called a recognition; but we cannot,
of course, accept it at its face-value; we must still ask
how much of it is essential, and whether one or more of
the three factors&mdash;name, feeling, ideas&mdash;may be left
out while recognition remains.</p>

<p>Experiment shows that the <i>one thing necessary to
recognition is the</i> <b>feeling of familiarity</b>. In some cases
the incoming ideas, and more especially the direct verbal
supplement of the perception, the name, seem to be
integral factors in the experience; but recognition is
possible in their absence; and, what is more, recognition
may fail in their presence; a perception may call
up ideas that are objectively correct, and yet there may
be no recognition of the thing perceived. <i>Recognition,
then, is essentially a feeling, a sense-feeling of the agreeable
and relaxing type, diffusively organic in its sensory
character</i>; any perception or idea to which this feeling
attaches is, by that very fact, the perception or idea of
something recognised. That is as far as analysis can
take us. If we care to go further, and speculate, we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
venture to guess that the feeling of familiarity is a weakened
survival of the <b>emotion of relief</b>, of fear unfulfilled.
There is a distinct touch of pleasurable relief, of the
letting-down of strain, in the feeling as we have it;
and the derivation is therefore psychologically reasonable.
Moreover, primitive man was so defenceless an
animal that the strange must always have been cause
for anxiety; language, indeed, bears witness on the
point; for ‘fear’ is, etymologically, the state of mind
of the traveller, the ‘farer’ away from home; and
‘hostis,’ which we translate enemy, originally meant
simply stranger. The bodily and mental attitude which
expresses recognition thus seems to be still the attitude
of going off guard, of ease and confidence. In our everyday
life, as you will readily see, the tinge of sense-feeling
may be overlaid by the heavier colours of some positive
emotion; we may recognise an acquaintance with
whom we are heartily angry, or whose conduct has
brought us sorrow; primitive man himself recognised
his enemies! But in the laboratory, where these disturbing
influences are ruled out, the nature of the feeling
of familiarity comes clearly to light; intrinsically,
recognition is always an agreeable and relaxing experience.</p>

<p>In everyday life, again, our <i>recognitions may be of all
degrees of definiteness</i>. They are indefinite when the
feeling of familiarity comes up alone, without the name
or the associated ideas; when, for instance, we pass
someone on the street, and say to our companion “I’m
sure I know that face!” and so pass on. They are
somewhat more definite when the perception is supplemented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
by a general name. As we glance down the
line of strangers in the street-car we may think to ourselves
“doctor,&mdash;farmer,&mdash;commercial traveller&mdash;soldier”;
the feeling of familiarity then represents our
recognition of the class. Lastly, they are definite when
one or more of the contributory factors&mdash;the name,
the organic stir of the feeling, the incoming ideas&mdash;carry
an unequivocal reference to our past experience,
mean some definite incident of our past life. We chance
to overhear a name in conversation; and “Why,” we
break in, “that’s the man I went up the Gross Glockner
with in ‘98!”&mdash;the recognition is definite. <i>There is
no real psychological difference</i> between the three cases;
the difference lies only in the range of meaning which
the contextual processes carry.</p>

<p><i>There is a psychological difference</i>, however, between
all the cases of recognition which we have hitherto
mentioned and certain other cases: a difference <i>between
direct and indirect recognition</i>. The recognition is direct
when the perception at once, of itself, calls up the recognitive
feeling. It is indirect when the feeling attaches,
not directly to the perception, but to some idea or some
other perception connected with the given perception.
We pass a stranger on the street; but we are suddenly
hailed by a familiar voice; the recognition of the voice
makes us look hard at the stranger’s face, and we then
recognise him as an old college friend. We try to find
our host’s face in a group-photograph of schoolboys,
and we are wholly puzzled to identify him; the face is
pointed out in the picture, and we turn from it to the
mature face with which we are familiar; the photograph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
grows more and more like, the more closely we compare
the two; presently we get a sudden conviction of their
identity, the recognition of the photograph is complete,
and we wonder that we could have failed to pick the
right boy at the outset. In both these instances, <i>recognition
hinges on the feeling of familiarity</i>; but something
else happens, something that reminds us of the second
connective pattern of p. 161, where an idea is read into
a perception, or the perception resolved into an idea.
There are times, too, when recognition is halting and
partial, when the feeling of familiarity alternates with
a feeling of strangeness; in such experiences the play of
associative tendencies may be extremely complex.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c181" id="c181">§ 39</a>. <b>Direct Apprehension.</b>&mdash;We saw on p. 120 that
meaning, which was at first a fringe of mental processes,
a contextual setting of some bit of bare experience, may
in course of time be carried by nerve-processes which
have no mental correlates of any kind. The same thing
seems to hold of recognition. We do not, in strictness,
‘recognise’ the clothes that we put on every morning,
or the desk at which we are accustomed to write; we
<b>apprehend</b> them, directly, as our clothes and our desk;
we take them for granted. The feeling of familiarity,
the feeling of being at home with our own things, changes
first to something that is still a feeling, though weaker
and more nebulous; to something that we may describe
as an ‘of-course’ feeling, which is still some distance
away from sheer indifference. As the days and weeks
go on, this of-course feeling itself dies out; the stimuli
no longer have power to arouse a feeling at all, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
organism faces the habitual situations without any organic
stir. We apprehend the clothes and desk <i>as</i> ours,
precisely as we perceive the tree and the piano <i>as</i> spatial
(p. 115). In experiments on the recognition of greys,
the author has reported positively that a particular
grey had been seen before, without being able to find
anything whatsoever, in the way of verbal idea or kinæsthetic
quiver or organic thrill, that might carry the
meaning of familiarity; the brain-habit just touched
off the report ‘Yes,’ and that was all that could
be said.</p>

<p><i>That brain-habit, however, had a psychological history
behind it; and the history shows itself whenever our direct
apprehension is in some manner disturbed or prevented.</i>
We reach out to our inkstand, and find that the pen
which always lies in it has disappeared; or we glance
round the breakfast-room, and notice that a picture
which always hangs upon a certain wall has gone. We
have not been wont to recognise the pen and the picture;
they were just matters of course. Now that they
are absent, however, the situation jars upon us; we
have a pronounced feeling of helplessness or of displeased
surprise. That is as far, perhaps, as ordinary observation
goes; but there is really more to be observed.
For at the moment of disturbance, before the disagreeable
feeling has arisen, the ‘of-course’ feeling springs
up in unusual strength; it is as if, for a brief space, we
reverted in imagination to a true recognition of the missing
object. And even after the displeasure is there, we
may go back more than once to the familiar state of
affairs; we can’t believe, as we say, we can’t trust our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
eyes, the thing has always been in that place; so that
the glow of recognition alternates with the dominant
feeling. In a word, <i>the disturbance of apprehension has
brought back to life certain stages in the past history of the
brain-habit</i>, stages in which the nerve-processes had as
their correlates the mental processes that make up the
feeling of familiarity.</p>

<p>This passage of recognition, from the characteristic
feeling of familiarity through the weaker of-course feeling
into a sheer brain-habit or nervous set, illustrates
the descending phase of a progression which is typical
in psychology, and which is summed up in the <b>law of
mental growth and decay</b>. We are constantly finding
that a mental formation, a particular complex of mental
processes, is at first thin and scant, then enriches itself
by various supplementary processes, and then again
thins out or tails off&mdash;finally, into mental nothingness;
and recognition illustrates the downward half of the
curve. The law was strongly insisted on by the late
G. H. Lewes, an author who wrote largely on psychological
topics, but who is better known to the general reader
from his association with George Eliot. “This process,”
Lewes tell us, “underlies all development. The
voluntary actions become involuntary, the involuntary
become automatic; the intelligent become habitual,
and the habitual become instinctive. It is the same
in the higher regions of intellect: the slow acquisitions
of centuries of research become condensed into axioms
which are intuitions.” We have already met the law
in our discussions of attention and meaning; and we
shall meet it again when we come to discuss action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2"><a name="c184" id="c184">§ 40</a>. <b>The Memory-Idea.</b>&mdash;But where, all this while,
is the memory-image? If you had been asked, before
you read the foregoing paragraphs, what happens when
you recognise somebody or something, you would probably
have replied, as the associationists reply: ‘The
present sight of the object calls up an <i>image</i> of that
object, by the law of similarity; then the image or idea
is compared with the perception, and the two are found
to agree; and this agreement is what I mean by recognition.’
If it were then objected that observation fails
to show any such idea or image, you would perhaps have
said: ‘The whole thing takes place so quickly that the
factors cannot ordinarily be distinguished; but all the
same that is what must happen.’ And so you would
have kept your faith in the image.</p>

<p><i>Such an image may, in fact, appear.</i> It may appear in
the cases of halting and partial recognition that we
referred to on p. 181; but it need not necessarily appear
even there; its intervention is, indeed, as rare as the
third type of mental connection, the clean-cut succession
of p. 161. You will perhaps get at the heart of the
matter most easily if we lay down, at once, the general
principle that <i>no imaginal process or complex of imaginal
processes is in its own right a memory-idea</i>. Even if
the simple images which compose it are different from
sensations (p. 77), it must still be called a complex
image, and nothing more; not an idea of memory. A
complex of imaginal processes becomes, <i>is made into</i>,
a memory-idea by an attendant feeling of familiarity;
just exactly as a perception, a complex of sensory processes,
is made into a recognition of something by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
same feeling of familiarity. So that <i>an idea, in order
to be a memory-idea, must bear the memory-label</i>; and
the label will be either the sense-feeling of familiarity
proper, or else some weaker and more fleeting feeling
of the ‘of-course’ kind. It is true, again, that an idea
which has lived through this history may be taken <i>as</i>
a memory-idea when the label has dropped away; but
even then it is a memory-idea, not in its own right, but
in right of the brain-habit behind it. No group of
images, taken out of its mental setting or removed from
the directive pressure of a brain-habit, can be known as
a memory; it might be hallucination or dream or
imagination or anything else; it is just a group of
images.</p>

<p>Our quarrel with popular psychology goes further
still. <i>The whole notion that a memory-idea is a copy of
past experience is wrong</i>; the idea may copy the perception,
but it need not; and usually it does not. You
remember that, after we had formulated our own law of
mental connection, we introduced the catch-phrase
‘marriage by proxy’; and you remember why. What,
now, is the essential thing about a memory-idea? Not,
surely, that it should copy past experience, but that it
should <i>mean</i> past experience. Our individual equipment
of images is so variable (p. 139) that we should be
very badly off if we were limited, in what we remember,
to copies of our perceptions; <i>A</i>, who has no visual images,
could then remember nothing that he had seen, and <i>B</i>,
who has no auditory images, could remember nothing
that he had heard! Such are the straits to which popular
psychology must logically reduce us. In point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
fact, <i>A</i> remembers well enough what he has seen; only,
the visual parts of his experience are translated into
other modes, perhaps verbal-motor. In that event a
verbal-motor image, set in the right context and accompanied
by a feeling of familiarity, may mean for <i>A</i> some
visual object that he perceived so many years since.
It goes flat against common sense to assert that a verbal-motor
image is the ‘memory’ of the visual perception;
and yet that is just what the verbal-motor image, in
its present setting, actually is.</p>

<p><i>This translation of perception into imagery of another
mode has curious consequences.</i> I may declare positively
that I remember having heard Patti sing forty
years ago, when all that I really remember is the statement
itself, the form of words which carries my meaning.
Nay more, if my mind is of the imaginal type, I may have
taken my cue from the verbal statement, and have
conjured up a mental picture of the performance, a picture
now so familiar that I could swear to the pink
dress,&mdash;were it not that a contemporary notice writes
it down as cream! <i>Words often repeated are in this way
highly deceptive</i>; and there is good psychology in the
story of the traveller who told his romantic tales so often
that he finally believed them himself. Many of us, if
we would but confess it, remember things that happened
before we were born; the account of them was impressed
on us in childhood, and was later bodied forth in images;
and now their ideas bear the memory-label. Here,
then, is one source of the ‘untrustworthiness’ of memory,
which is at the same time a possible source of the
Platonic doctrine of reminiscence.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c187" id="c187">§ 41</a>. <b>Illusions of Recognition and Memory.</b>&mdash;Psychologically,
an illusory memory is a memory, just as
an illusory perception is a perception. We speak of
<i>illusion</i> when our experience fails to square with what,
from our knowledge of external circumstances and of
other like experiences, we might have expected; the
distinction is therefore practical, not scientific. We shall
avail ourselves of it, partly for convenience’ sake, and
partly because certain cases of illusion offer special
problems to the psychologist.</p>

<p>Most of us, probably, have an occasional acquaintance
with what is called <b>paramnesia</b> or wrong recognition:
a definite ‘feeling that all this has happened before,’
sometimes connected with a ‘feeling that we know exactly
what is coming,’&mdash;a ‘feeling’ which persists for
a few seconds and carries positive conviction, in spite
of the fact and the knowledge that the experience is
novel; Dickens gives an instance in <i>David Copperfield</i>.
Various explanations have been offered of the phenomenon.
It occurs most frequently after periods of emotional
stress, or in the state of extreme mental fatigue;
that is, at a time when the associative tendencies in the
brain are abnormally weak; and it seems to depend, essentially,
upon a disjunction of mental processes that
are normally held together in a single state of attention.
Suppose the following case: you are about to cross a
crowded street, and you take a hasty glance in both directions
to make sure of a safe passage. Now your eye is
caught, for a moment, by the contents of a shop window;
and you pause, though only for a moment, to
survey the window before you actually cross the street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
Paramnesia would then appear as the feeling that you
had already crossed; the preliminary glance up and
down, which ordinarily connects with the crossing in a
single attentive experience, is disjoined from the crossing;
the look at the window, casual as it was, has been
able to disrupt the associative tendencies. As you cross,
then, you think ‘Why, I crossed this street just now’;
your nervous system has severed two phases of a single
experience, both of which are familiar, and the latter of
which appears accordingly as a repetition of the earlier.
The illusion will evidently be strengthened if, as is only
natural, the casual look at the window does not recur
to you. This is an imaginary case, simplified for clearness
of exposition; and we cannot be at all sure that
the explanation which it suggests is correct; for cases
of paramnesia cannot be realised at will, and the nervous
condition that leads to them is not favourable to
scientific observation; but something of the sort must
take place.</p>

<p>Illusions of memory have been touched upon on p. 186.
We may remember something that never happened; we
may remember something that happened, but could
not have happened to us; we make all kinds of mistakes
in memory; we fail to remember a great deal that has
happened. These chances of error are inherent in the
laws of associative tendency, and in the character of the
memory-image. There is one illusion, however, that requires
a word of comment: the illusion of the ‘<b>good old
days</b>,’ the tendency of every man past middle age to be
<i>laudator temporis acti se puero</i>. This has often been referred
to the principle that we remember pleasurable experiences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
better than unpleasurable; we are so constituted,
it is said, that the disagreeable events of our past life are
forgotten and the agreeable are conserved in memory.
The principle, however, has never been established, and
there is some experimental evidence against it. In all
probability, <i>the illusion is due to many contributing factors</i>.
First of all, our nervous system takes its general
set in childhood; it is then that we acquire standards
of right and wrong, of social position, of daily intercourse
and occupation. In so far as later experiences
interfere with this set, the old order will be preferred.
Secondly, our self-centredness (p. 2) leads us to idealise
our past self; we think of ourselves as more important,
more heroic, more dominating, more regarded, not only
than we were, but also than any youngster of our sort
could possibly have been; autobiographies, however
truthful in intention, bring out the point with sufficient
clearness. So we contrast our present struggles with the
triumphs of an unreal past. Thirdly, the old days were,
in one sense, really happier for us than the new; happier
because we had no responsibilities, because there was a
generation of adults to whom we could appeal; and we
are very prone to confuse our own greater comfort with
a better status of society. These are obvious considerations,
but they and things like them are enough to account
for the illusion.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c189" id="c189">§ 42</a>. <b>The Pattern of Memory.</b>&mdash;Psychology cannot
yet offer any adequate description of the pattern that
mental processes display, the arrangement that they
fall into, when we are remembering. Memory, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
are all aware, may occur in the state of primary attention,
when we call it remembrance, or in the state of secondary
attention, when we call it recollection. Something
may be said under both heads; but our account must be
largely figurative and conventional.</p>

<p>Let us take <b>remembrance</b> first. There seems to be,
as it were in the background, something that holds us
down to a particular circle of ideas, or, in other words,
that limits the play of ideas to some particular situation.
This something may be a group of contextual
mental processes, or may be merely a nervous disposition;
we shall have more to say of it later (§ 48). Upon
the background move mental processes of extraordinary
instability, all of them tinged more or less strongly by
the feeling of familiarity. Attention is labile and fluid;
the focus is occupied now by visual or other imagery,
now by scraps of kinæsthesis, and now by organic or
verbal processes that carry a personal meaning and reference;
and the whole mental stream contracts and expands,
pauses and hurries, and shows the most abrupt
changes of direction. All of which is sadly vague! but
let the reader catch himself ‘reminiscing,’ and he will
realise the general truth of the description, and also the
extreme difficulty of making it more concrete.</p>

<p>In <b>recollection</b>, the background is filled by the intent
to recall; and this intent may, again, be constituted
by contextual mental processes or carried by a nervous
set. The course of recollection may then be characterised
as <i>a reconstruction along the lines of least resistance</i>.
Some bit of imagery, some form of words comes up, and
is at once met, so to say, by the feeling of familiarity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Further ideas present themselves, in more or less disorderly
fashion, and the feeling plays upon them, accepting
here and rejecting there, serving throughout the
experience as a court of final appeal. Some of the ideas
are directly recognised; some seem to force our acceptance
by their vividness; some pass muster because
familiar verbal ideas, names or phrases, are connected
with them. Some, that leave us in doubt as they arise,
are shelved for the time, to be judged later on, when the
positive acceptances are done with; and they are likely
to be judged in the light of these acceptances, and of our
general knowledge of the situation which we are trying
to recall; even a weak recognitive feeling is enough to
give them status. In and out among these ideas run
threads of kinæsthesis, which imitate or repeat fragments
of the original experience. There is thus a veritable
tangle of processes; the situation is not reproduced
in image, and its items read off in logical order; it is
rather reconstructed; and the reconstruction follows,
as has been said, the lines of least resistance at the moment.
Yet we are so accustomed to the logical order of
speech that our narrative, as recollection proceeds,
may give but little hint of the tangled interplay of ideas;
at most we may correct ourselves at points, or remark
that just now we left something out. Observe the flow
of mind itself, and the disorder is apparent.</p>

<p>We may say, then, that <i>the pattern of memory is a
discursive movement within fixed boundaries</i>; the boundaries
are given by the set or background, as we have
named it, by the fact (in other words) that we are recalling
a particular situation or event; and the discursiveness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
reveals itself in roaming of attention and shift
of ideas, which imply a variable activity of the associative
tendencies. The characteristic processes are the
<i>feeling of familiarity</i> and the <i>imitative kinæsthesis</i>.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c192" id="c192">§ 43</a> <b>Mnemonics.</b>&mdash;Rules for remembering, tricks
of memorising, were considered of great importance in
the ancient world; oratory was highly esteemed; and
no orator before the time of Augustus would have ventured
to use notes. As the art declined, these rules
were less and less regarded; we hear practically nothing
of them between the first and the thirteenth centuries
of the present era. From that date, however, interest
in <i>artificial memory-systems</i> has never died out; they
have been recommended for sermons, for lectures, for
disputations, for public speeches, for the learning of
foreign languages, for examinations, for practically every
occasion in which memory is employed, as well as for
the improvement of memory itself.</p>

<p><i>The great principle of mnemonics is that you remember
the novel and the disconnected by bringing it into arbitrary
relation to the familiar and the connected.</i> Everybody, for
instance, is thoroughly at home in his own house; the
positions of the rooms are known, and their employment
for the necessary purposes of the family holds
them together. Suppose, then, that you are to deliver
a speech, and that the speech has eight principal points.
You think of yourself as entering the house: the first
point you deposit in the hall, the second in the drawing-room,
the third in the library, the fourth in the back
hall, the fifth in the kitchen, the sixth in the pantry, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
seventh in the dining-room, the eighth on the upstairs
landing. You think of yourself as making the separate
points in these different places; if possible, you invent
some fanciful connection between the point and the
place where you deposit it; if, for example, your second
or drawing-room point is an historical reference, you
might think of ‘drawing a hiss’ from your audience;
anything will do, provided it is the sort of thing to stick!
This local or <i>topographical way of memorising</i> has always
been popular; it is said that our ordinary phrases ‘in
the first place,’ ‘in the second place,’ derive from it.
<i>Number-alphabets</i>, in which certain letters stand for certain
figures, are also much employed; dates, physical
constants, statistical numbers, may thus be memorised.
The <i>rhythm of verse</i> has been appealed to; if you want
to remember the seven cities that laid claim to the birth
of Homer, you learn the hexameter-line ‘Smyrna,
Chios, Colophon, Salamis, Rhodos, Argos, Athenæ’;
and you are helped&mdash;if further help is wanted&mdash;by the
pattern of the initial letters SCCS-RAA.</p>

<p><i>Such devices have a special and temporary utility</i>; we
have all taken examinations, and probably we have all
had recourse to them on a larger or smaller scale. Many
of us have paid the not infrequent penalty; we have
remembered our mnemonic doggerel, but have forgotten
the key to it, and so have forgotten the events or numbers
that it was meant to recall; there is always that
danger. <i>No scheme of memory-aids that is universally
applicable and universally reliable has been or can be
discovered</i>; there is no royal road to learning. In so
far as a mnemonic rule follows the laws of associative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
tendency, as for many minds the local or topographical
rule seems to do; or in so far as it chimes with some
peculiarity of individual thinking; in so far, it will be
of practical service in daily life; that is the most that
can be said.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c194" id="c194">§ 44</a>. <b>The Idea of Imagination.</b>&mdash;We think of memory
as reproducing the old, and of imagination, no less
positively, as producing the new; the very word <i>poet</i>
means the maker, and the word <i>artist</i> means the fitter
or joiner. Imagination cannot, of course, give us new
qualities of experience; we cannot imagine a new colour,
different from all known colours, or a new sensation&mdash;say,
a specific sensation of electricity&mdash;different from
the known sensations of skin and underlying tissues.
<i>Imagination does, however, give us novel connections</i>;
and experiment shows that an idea comes to us as imagined
only if it comes as unfamiliar, with the feeling
of novelty or strangeness upon it.</p>

<p>In real life, the <b>feeling of strangeness</b> is soon swamped
by alien feelings, by the artist’s joy or pride, dissatisfaction
or despair; in the laboratory, it appears strongly
by itself. The observers speak of a feeling of novelty,
of personal detachment, of creepiness, of weirdness, of
something out of the ordinary, of peculiar discomfort.
Compare this list of terms with a sentence from Lafcadio
Hearn’s last book: “The outward strangeness of things
in Japan produces a queer thrill impossible to describe,&mdash;a
feeling of weirdness which comes to us only with
the perception of the totally unfamiliar”; there is no
doubt that the same experience is intended. It is, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
first thought, a little surprising that an idea of imagination,
which after all derives from the observers’ own experience,
and which is obtained under the rather tame
and colourless conditions of a psychological experiment,
should have so strong a tinge of feeling. Yet we need
not be surprised; for we have already learned that the
novel stimulus has power to compel the attention; it
stands alone and unrelated; and for that reason it
startles and arrests us (p. 94). If the ideas aroused in
the laboratory mattered, if they were practically important
for their owners’ careers, then the feeling of
strangeness would, as we have said, be overborne by
other feelings; but they do not matter, and so can be
developed and observed for what they are.</p>

<p>An idea, then, becomes or <i>is made into</i> an idea of
imagination by its mental setting, which is this feeling
of strangeness, the opposite of the feeling of familiarity.
As regards the nature of the feeling, we may guess that
it is <i>the modern representative of primitive man’s anxiety
and uneasiness in face of the unknown</i>, an echo from the
time when the new was the dangerous (p. 179). If the
idea is often repeated, the feeling wears off, and is replaced
by a directive brain-habit; we still take it <i>as</i> an
idea of imagination, but we do not re-imagine it. If it
is still further repeated, it ceases even to be taken as
imaginative, and becomes one of the habitual images
that we spoke of on p. 77.</p>

<p>There is a second difference between <i>the idea of imagination</i>
and the idea of memory: the difference, namely,
that the former <i>cannot be replaced by another mode of
imagery</i>. An idea of imagination must not simply mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
something new; it must <i>be</i> something new. We know
that images of imagination are not indispensable to
artistic work; painters do not necessarily possess visual
imagery (p. 141). Where the idea of imagination does
exist, however, it keeps its original form. The French
mural painter Puvis de Chavannes used to contemplate,
for days together, the bare spaces that he was to fill;
‘wasting time,’ a friend told him, and received the reply
“I have to see my picture before I can paint it.” In a
case like this, the mental picture&mdash;though it may be
modified as the actual colours are laid on, or as new outlines
suggest themselves to the painter&mdash;must, so far
as it furnishes a guide and model, hold its form and
colour-scheme almost as fixedly as a perception; otherwise
it would be useless. So a man may be a very good
musician, and possess no auditory images. Yet Beethoven
composed his Ninth Symphony in 1823, when he
had long been deaf; and he could not even have helped
his mental ear by the kinæsthesis of singing, since without
special education the deaf soon lose control of the
larynx. In his case, therefore, the auditory imagination
must not only have held good, but must also have
grown more complex and more keenly discriminative,
up to the very end. No doubt, he was aided by the
eye; the symphony grew on paper, a theme at a time;
and, no doubt also, he used his general knowledge of
what would sound aright and what would not; he was
a practised composer. But, when all allowance is made,
his main reliance must have been on auditory imagery,
and this must have remained as stable as auditory perception.
Such instances prove that <i>the idea of imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
runs a different course from the idea of memory</i>. The
memory-idea is common to all minds; it persists as
meaning, under the limitations of imaginal type and the
general laws of associative tendency. <i>The idea of imagination
seems to depend rather upon special endowment</i>;
it persists in kind, also under the limitations of imaginal
type; and it is conserved by some special grouping or
‘convergence’ of associative tendencies (p. 158). We do
not hesitate to describe a man as ‘wholly lacking in
imagination,’ though we should look upon a total lack
of memory as a sign of mental incompetence; and the
common phrase brings out, well enough, this personal
or idiosyncratic character of the idea of imagination.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c197" id="c197">§ 45</a>. <b>The Pattern of Imagination.</b>&mdash;Imagination, like
memory, may occur in the state of primary or of secondary
attention. In the former case we call it receptive,
in the latter case constructive imagination.</p>

<p>What happens in <b>receptive imagination</b> is, in principle,
very simple. We are confronted by new perceptions or
ideas, and we supplement these experiences by <i>complex
images of the appropriate kind</i>. We read, for instance, a
traveller’s account of an African forest, and we picture
the forest as we read; we receive the score of a new song,
and the melody sings itself to us as we run our eye over
the printed notes; we stand upon an historic site, and
rehearse in image the scenes that it has witnessed. A
certain definite direction is given to our ideas by the
presented stimuli; then the ideas, as they come in their
predetermined order, are supplemented in this imaginal
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>The characteristic <i>feeling of strangeness</i>, in such cases,
is often interfused with an experience which might, at
first sight, seem incompatible with it; the <i>’feeling’ of
our own concernment</i> in the imagined situation. We have
a natural tendency to feel ourselves into what we perceive
or imagine. As we read about the forest, we may,
as it were, <i>become</i> the explorer; we feel for ourselves
the gloom, the silence, the humidity, the oppression, the
sense of lurking danger; everything is strange, but it is
to us that the strange experience has come. We are
told of a shocking accident, and we gasp and shrink
and feel nauseated as we imagine it; we are told of some
new and delightful fruit, and our mouth waters as if we
were about to taste it. This tendency to feel oneself
<i>into</i> a situation is called <b>empathy</b>,&mdash;on the analogy of
sympathy, which is feeling <i>together with</i> another; and
empathic ideas are psychologically interesting, because
they are the converse of perceptions: their core is
imaginal, and their context is made up of sensations, the
kinæsthetic and organic sensations that carry the empathic
meaning. Like the feeling of strangeness, they
are characteristic of imagination. In memory, their
place is taken by the <i>imitative</i> experiences, which repeat
over again certain phases of the original situation.</p>

<p>What happens in <b>constructive imagination</b> is not so
easy to say. Genius is defined sometimes as the capacity
of doing great things without effort, and sometimes as
the capacity of taking infinite pains; and constructive
imagination, in the same way, is represented now as a
native gift that finds rather than seeks expression, and
now as a sort of skilled labour, a matter of planning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
moulding and constructing. There is probably truth on
both sides, and a degree of truth that varies with the
individual make-up of the artist; in general, however,
there is more hard work and less inspiration than is
usually supposed. The poet or the inventor starts out
with a more or less definite plan or aim or ambition;
and the plan persists, if only as a nervous disposition, to
determine the course of his ideas. It also helps to initiate
the imaginative complex, the first clue to which seems
in fact to come, at least ordinarily, as an inspiration, a
happy thought; some external situation, or some grouping
of the associative tendencies that is active at the
moment, touches off the disposition, and the initial
idea flashes into mind. Whether this first idea is crude
or complete, and whether the stream of later ideas is
broad or narrow, these things depend altogether upon
circumstances. Now, at any rate, begins the stage of
skilled labour; the idea is worked upon and worked over;
the plan decides what shall be accepted, what rejected,
what put aside for another trial; we are reminded of
the course of recollection,&mdash;only that rejection, active
as it is in memory, is still more to the fore in imagination,
and construction is more critical than reconstruction.
Here and there other happy thoughts may crop
up; but in essentials this stage of hard work continues,
until the idea attains its final expression in objective
terms, in the words of the poem, for instance, or in the
effective machine. Meantime, there have been all sorts
of feelings. The imaginative ideas bring with them their
own feeling of strangeness; but this may be overwhelmed
by the joy of success or the irritation of failure;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and these feelings may themselves alternate, swinging
from extreme to extreme. Meantime, also, there have
been all sorts of empathic experiences, which have
formed about the focal processes, vivifying and personalising
the partial products of the constructive effort;
and they too find their natural term in the actual accomplishment
of the imaginative task. Figurative,
again, all this, and lamentably far from scientific
accuracy,&mdash;but, in broad outline and on the average,
we may hope that it is true to the psychological facts.</p>

<p>How, now, does the pattern of imagination compare
with that of memory? We saw that the memory-pattern
is that of discursive movement within fixed
boundaries, the limits set by the fixity of the past occurrence
which is remembered. Imagination, on the
other hand, is a more or less steady flow, in a single
direction, from the fountain-head of disposition; there
are no limits of any kind, save those of individual
capacity and experience; but the course is determined by
the initial plan or ambition. <i>Memory is discursive
movement within fixed boundaries; imagination is progressive
movement from a constant source. Memory is
characterised by the feeling of familiarity and by imitative
kinæsthesis; imagination by the feeling of strangeness and
by empathy.</i></p>

<p>§ 46. <b>The Nature of Instinct.</b>&mdash;We left the sense-feelings
a long time ago (§ 18), though we have made occasional
reference to them and to emotion in recent paragraphs.
Now we return to the feeling-side of mind; but
we must begin with an account of <b>instinct</b>, which is related
both to emotion and to action.</p>

<p>Instinct and reason are familiar catch-words of popular
psychology. Animals are said to act ‘on instinct,’
while man, at any rate in his specifically human capacity,
acts ‘by reason.’ The terms, as thus used, are not
descriptive but explanatory. Just as a mental connection
is supposed to be explained by similarity or contiguity
of ideas (p. 146), so a particular activity or performance
is supposed to be explained when we have
labelled it ‘instinctive’ or ‘rational.’ But what is
instinct?</p>

<p><i>If we observe the behaviour of the lower animals, we find
two sorts of response to stimulation: the one points to the
working of an inherited nervous mechanism, the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
depends upon nervous connections formed during the
life-time of the individual.</i> The second year’s bird builds
the nest of its species, though it has never built a nest
before; the cage-reared migrant beats its wings against
the bars at the approach of winter, though it has never
taken flight to the southward. Here is behaviour
that we must refer to innate nervous tendencies, to the
working of an inherited nervous mechanism. If, on
the other hand, the parent birds come to the window-sill
and take crumbs from our hand, we are in presence of
behaviour of the second type. The difference, in the
broad, is clear enough; only we must not press it too
far. The second year’s bird, we say, builds the nest of
its species; but one nest is never quite like another;
something will depend upon the situation. Contrariwise,
the birds would not come to the window if they
had not an innate attraction to food, or a natural boldness
of disposition, or a native tendency to flock with their
fellows. The two sorts of behaviour can be distinguished;
but they are likely to enter together, though
in unequal degree, into one and the same performance.</p>

<p><b>Instinct</b>, <i>now, is the general name for these innate
tendencies to behaviour</i>. The word explains nothing;
it is the business of science to find out what the inherited
nervous mechanisms are, and how they work;
but though nothing is explained, we are helped by the
term toward a <i>classification</i> of the facts of behaviour. All
of man’s conduct will be instinctive, for example, that
can be shown to issue from innate nervous tendencies;
and further, all of man’s conduct will be <i>in so far</i> instinctive
as innate nervous tendencies can be shown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
have a share in producing it. <i>How large a part, then,
does instinct, in this sense, play in the life of man?</i> Not
a question that can be answered offhand! For you
might argue, as has been argued, that because man is the
most flexible and adaptable and teachable of all animals,
because he lives in all climates and thrives in the most
varied conditions of life, therefore he has but few instincts.
Or you might argue that, since man has undergone
more change and has progressed further than any
other animal; since his evolutionary history, though
not longer in time, is richer in biological incident than
that of the other animals; therefore he must have a
great variety of instincts, or at any rate a great variety
of inherited nervous mechanisms that help to guide and
shape his conduct. What are the facts?</p>

<p>If we try to work out a rough list of human instincts,
we find, at the lower end of the scale, a number of
<i>definite modes of response to particular stimuli</i>; such
things as coughing, sneezing, swallowing, smiling,
threading our way in the street, beating time to music;
or, in the baby, such things as sucking, clasping, biting,
turning the head aside, standing, creeping, walking, crying,
vocalising. At the upper end of the scale, we find
<i>gross general tendencies</i>: the tendency to take the world
of perception as a world of real things in outside space
(p. 115); the empathic tendency to humanise and personalise
our surroundings (p. 198); the social tendency
that makes us imitative and credulous; the tendency to
classify everything in pairs; the tendency to try things
out, which is always at war with the tendency to let
things be. These tendencies, and others of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
character, represent directive pressures laid upon the organism,
more strongly upon some individuals and more
weakly upon others, but in some measure upon all;
they are realised or expressed on very various occasions,
and with wide differences of mental accompaniment.
We have spoken of some of them already; and instances
may be found for the looking. Take the empathic
tendency: what lover of books has not shifted
the place of certain volumes on a shelf, because he could
not bear to put good and bad, sound and trivial, side by
side,&mdash;as if the <i>books</i> would feel the incongruity?
Take the social tendency: we all tend to pay respect to
fashion, even the silliest; we all tend to believe what
we see printed in large headlines; we are all gullible, if
only the cheat speaks to us in good English and appeals
to our habitual standards of living. The tendency to
classify by pairs shows not only in the dogmatism of
uneducated persons&mdash;an action must be positively right
or wrong, a man must be positively innocent or guilty&mdash;but
also in the structure of systems of philosophy, in
the distinctions of active-passive, subject-object, body-mind,
thing-attribute, appearance-reality, and so on.
The tendency to try things out is largely responsible
both for the play of the child and the research of the
man of science; read Andrew Lang’s story of the first
radical! The tendency to let things be, the conservative
tendency, is on its side largely responsible for the
laziness of a life of routine.</p>

<p>Between these extremes lie <i>the instincts that are so
called in our ordinary speech</i>, and that you would probably
have thought of, if you had been asked to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
examples of human instincts: such things as fear, love,
rivalry, jealousy, pugnacity, bashfulness, self-assertion,
various lines of ‘interest.’ All these names, and many
like them, stand for inherited nervous dispositions which
are realised or expressed in emotion. They too are
differently combined, and exist in varying degree, in
different individuals; and they too are common, in some
measure, to all humanity.</p>

<p><i>Can we now say how man compares, in the matter of
instinct, with the lower animals?</i> James commits himself
so far as to declare that “no other mammal, not even
the monkey, shows so large an array.” The statement
is probably true, if we mean by instinct, not a fixed and
unchanging mode of response to the given stimulus or
situation, but rather an equipment of innate tendencies
that may form the basis of all sorts of response; an all-round
readiness of behaviour, as it were, such that no
stimulus or situation finds us wholly unprepared, while
yet the preparation is not so narrow and definite as to
force us into special and invariable response. Civilised
man ‘reasons’ always on the basis of his instinctive
tendencies; his ‘instincts,’ on the other hand, are in
general less absorbingly possessive and less close-knit
than those of lower forms of life.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c207" id="c207">§ 47</a>. <b>The Two Sides of Instinct.</b>&mdash;If instinct is
the general name for the innate nervous tendencies to
behaviour, then the detailed study of instinct belongs to
physiology and general biology. The psychologist is
concerned with it only in so far as the innate tendencies
guide and form the stream of thought. There is, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
another side to instinct, which makes it a matter of
direct psychological observation; the touching-off of an
instinctive response may be accompanied by mental
processes, by sensations and feeling. We must say
something of instinct in both relations; and we look at
it, first, from the <b>biological</b> point of view.</p>

<p>The list of instincts given on pp. 205 ff. includes tendencies
of very different kinds, simple and complex, variable
and constant. Sweeping statements are therefore dangerous;
we must be careful to guard our generalisations
by giving instances. That premised, we note, to begin
with, that <i>the innate tendencies are rarely perfect</i>, completely
ready for action, at birth; they ripen as the organism
developes. The child does not learn to walk, or the
bird to fly, in any strict sense of the word ‘learn’; the
innate tendencies settle to their perfect work as time goes
on. We note, secondly, that the tendencies may <i>ripen at
very different levels of individual development</i>; the culmination
of sex-interest at adolescence, the appearance of
bashfulness in the child of three or four years, the lack
of fear in the new-born babe, are cases in point. Thirdly,
they are extraordinarily <i>persistent</i>. Our instincts, no
doubt, wax and wane; but they change far less than their
outward expression would indicate. The boy, we say,
goes through the collecting stage, and therewith an end;
but do not grown men too collect, if they have time and
money? The little girl with her doll is the later mother
with her child; and the play of the child persists in the
technical play of the gambler and the experimental
essays of the man of science. Fourthly, they are <i>by
no means harmonious among themselves</i>. In many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
animals the instinct to crouch motionless conflicts with
the instinct to flee from the object of fear, and you may
see them obeying now the one and now the other. Curiosity
conflicts with alarm: watch a young child on its
first introduction to a dog or a beetle! The sparrow is
at once audacious and cautious, bold and timid; and
every human adult&mdash;despite the song in <i>Iolanthe</i>&mdash;is
both conservative and radical. Fifthly, they are
looser, have (so to say) <i>a greater freedom of play</i>, than is
commonly supposed; and this in two directions; the
same response may be touched off by situations that have
only a general resemblance; and, conversely, situations
that seem to be identical may touch off responses that
show a good deal of difference. In briefer statement,
like stimuli may call out the same response: we smile
from happiness or from superiority; and the same stimulus
repeated may call out responses that are hardly even
like: the extreme case is, perhaps, our crying or laughing
for joy. Sixthly, they are <i>liable to be checked, turned
aside, inhibited, by acquired nervous tendencies</i>; habit is
not only second nature, but may also overcome nature.
A chick pecks at an humble-bee, and pays the penalty;
thereafter it rejects yolk of egg. A pike in an aquarium,
separated from minnows by a glass screen, struck repeatedly
at its natural prey and bumped its head;
when the screen was removed, the minnows were left
undisturbed. If a sheet of glass is placed before the
eyes, and a rubber-tipped hammer springs up and hits it,
you wink, perhaps, for the first hundred times; but you
can presently inhibit the wink. This liability to inhibition
is, of course, more obvious in the case of the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
complex tendencies. Seventhly, they are <i>liable to
specialisation</i>. A bird builds its nest in a certain
suitable place; and then, though the site may become
increasingly dangerous and exposed, persists in building
there again, year after year. The routes that various
birds follow in their migratory flight south and north
show the same kind of specialised set. Eighthly and
lastly, the more complicated tendencies may, especially
in the case of man, be <i>broken up into partial tendencies</i>;
and these partial tendencies may then form connections
of the most varied sort with acquired tendencies. A
father strikes a blow in defence of his child: love and
hate and possibly fear are involved; if the deed is done
in public, such social instincts as love of approbation
and fear of ridicule may come in; all these instincts are
concerned, and yet the father would give you his reasons
for the blow! Civilised man, we said, always ‘reasons’
on the basis of his instinctive tendencies; we had better
have said that he reasons on the basis of various fragments
of instinctive tendency, disjoined from their
original connections and recombined for an immediate
purpose.</p>

<p>So much for the biological side of instinct. We have
no space for a longer treatment; though, indeed, if you
go to the larger works, you will find little more that
is definite and firmly established; the detailed study of
the innate tendencies has hardly begun. If we turn now
to the <b>mental accompaniments</b> of instinctive response,
we find ourselves in even worse case; we know practically
nothing. It is clear that <i>some of the more limited
responses have a characteristic mental correlate</i>&mdash;think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
coughing, sneezing, smiling&mdash;which may, however, according
to circumstances, be either vivid or so obscure
as to escape notice. It is clear, again, that <i>the empathic
tendencies are likely to be characterised by more or less
massive complexes of organic sensation</i>; and it is perhaps
true that this <b>organic surge</b> represents the mental aspect
of the instincts proper, those that pass over into emotions;
for they are responses or reactions of the whole
organism, and not of some particular organ or member.
<i>Most of the large directive pressures</i>, that we placed at the
upper end of the scale, <i>show themselves rather in the volume
and trend of the mental stream</i> than in the addition of
new processes, though it is quite possible that they imply
specific bodily attitudes, and arouse specific patterns of
kinæsthesis in head or eyes, from breathing or from the
muscular set of the trunk. We all know how it feels
to be critically on guard against deception; but is there
not, sometimes at any rate, a felt attitude of acceptance,
of credulity? could we not, sometimes, after the serious-faced
jester has played his trick upon us, <i>feel</i> ourselves
back into our credulous attitude? We all know, again,
how disconcerting it is to be faced by a third possibility
when we have comfortably reduced things to a choice of
alternatives; but can we not, now and then, catch ourselves
in a <i>felt</i> attitude of dividing by two? Let the
reader keep an eye on his own experiences! Lastly, a
response that is often repeated will illustrate the psychological
law of growth and decay (p. 183); the organic
and kinæsthetic sensations will be supplemented by
<i>images</i>, which will increase up to a certain point, and
thereafter fall away. Fear of the dark is one instance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the use and disuse of terms of endearment offer another.</p>

<p>As regards <b>feeling</b>, we can only say that all six types of
sense-feeling&mdash;the agreeable and disagreeable, the exciting
and subduing, the straining and relaxing&mdash;may
appear in connection with instinctive responses, and
especially with those that we have placed in the middle
portion of the scale. Such words as fear, pugnacity,
rivalry, carry the stamp of feeling upon them.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c212" id="c212">§ 48</a>. <b>Determining Tendencies.</b>&mdash;The reader must
have felt for some time past that we sorely need a
technical term for all the directive nerve-forces, brain-habits,
instinctive tendencies, and so forth, that figure in
psychological discussion. There is such a term, formed
on the analogy of ‘associative tendencies’; psychologists
are coming more and more to speak of <b>determining
tendencies</b>. Any nervous set or disposition that turns
our attention in a certain direction, that casts our perceptions
into a certain form, that places a definite meaning
upon an equivocal word, that governs our response to
a particular situation, may be called a determining tendency.
Some of these tendencies are simple, and some
are extremely complex; some are inherited, and some
are acquired in the life-time of the individual. All alike
<i>lay down a path of least resistance for the psychoneural
processes</i> (p. 164) <i>to follow</i>, and thus determine the flow
of the mental stream.</p>

<p>Why, then, has not the term been introduced before?
would not its use have simplified things, have brought
the different topics together, have saved a good deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of roundabout phrasing? No doubt. But <i>there are two
dangers in the use of such a technical term</i>. The one is
that you think merely the words themselves, and do not
carry your thought back to the nervous system. A
determining tendency is an affair not of mind but of
body; and if we had used the words from the outset,
you might easily have slipped into the belief that there
are determining tendencies in the mind, and might thus
have left the nervous system out of account. Have you
not&mdash;to be honest!&mdash;thought and spoken of your
‘bodily sensations’ ever since you studied the chapter
on sensation? Yet there are no physical or bodily
sensations, any more than there are mental determining
tendencies; the bodily processes correlated with sensation
are not the sensation, and the mental flow correlated
with a nervous tendency is not that tendency.
The second danger is that you look upon the technical
term as self-explanatory; so that, just as popular psychology
explains the conduct of the lower animals by
‘instinct,’ without ever asking what instinct is or how
it explains, you too explain certain mental phenomena
by ‘determining tendency,’ forgetting that the work of
correlation is still all to do. New terms bring these
risks, that you put the word in place of the facts and confuse
a label with an explanation; but they are also inevitable,
when new observations accumulate; and this particular
term should now be as harmless as it is necessary.</p>

<p>We shall meet the determining tendencies again, when
we come to deal with action and thought. Meantime
let us note that they furnish a definition of that rather
obscure word ‘suggestion.’ A <b>suggestion</b> is something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
that comes to us with more or less of the force of a command;
but what does this ‘force of a command’
mean? Our new technical term helps us: a suggestion
is <i>any stimulus to nervous activity, external or internal,
with or without mental accompaniment, that touches off a
determining tendency</i>. The determining tendency may
be realised, or may be inhibited, as circumstances decide;
the essence of a suggestion is, always and everywhere,
that it releases such a tendency. Thus, the psychological
observer of whom we spoke on p. 96 received from the experimenter
certain instructions; these instructions were
obeyed, that is, they were effective suggestions. What,
now, set up the determining tendency to follow instructions?
A foregone suggestion: the student came
into the laboratory to observe, to be taught, to put himself
under direction. What brought him into the laboratory?
Another foregone suggestion: the wish to learn
psychology at first hand, the example of his friends.
What led him to choose at the university the course
that includes psychology? What led him to choose this
particular university? What led him to enter any university?
All these results are due to suggestions, which
grow in number and complexity the farther back we go;
and the force of the suggestions, in every case, is their
appeal to determining tendencies. A nervous system
that lacked these tendencies would furnish its possessor
with connections that were all, so to speak, on the same
plane; the organism could neither lead nor follow, neither
choose nor reject, neither work nor play; it would not
be suggestible.</p>

<p>From this digression we pass to the study of emotion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
which, as we have seen, is closely related to the instincts
of the middle part of our scale.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c215" id="c215">§ 49</a>. <b>The Nature of Emotion.</b>&mdash;Suppose that you
are sitting at your desk, busy in your regular way;
and suppose that a street-car passes by the house. The
familiar rumble does not distract you; it slips in among
the obscure processes of the margin. Suddenly you
hear a shrill scream; and now the noise of the car shoots
to the focus of attention, becomes the context of the
scream. You leap up, as if the scream were a personal
signal that you had been expecting; you dash out of
doors, as if your presence on the street were imperatively
necessary. As you run, you have fragmentary ideas:
‘a child,’ perhaps, in internal speech; a visual flash of
some previous accident; a momentary kinæsthetic
set, the stiffening of protest, that represents your whole
attitude to the city car-system. But you have, also, a
mass of insistent organic sensation: you choke, you
draw your breath in gasps, for all the hurry you are in a
cold sweat, you have a horrible nausea; and yet, in
spite of the intense discomfort that floods you, you have
no choice but to go on. In describing the experience
later, you would say that you were horrified by hearing
a child scream; the mental processes that we have just
named make up the <b>emotion</b> of horror.</p>

<p>An emotion is thus a <i>temporal</i> experience, a course of
connected processes; it begins, in our illustration, with
the empathic perception of the scream, and lasts through
and beyond the events that we have described; indeed,
the last traces of the horror may not wear off for days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
It is also, characteristically, a <i>suddenly aroused</i> experience;
it begins abruptly, though it dies down gradually;
the accident comes upon you all at once, and drives
everything else out of mind. It is highly <i>complex</i>, since
its stimulus is not a single object, a perceptive stimulus,
but a total situation or predicament, which may arouse
all sorts of ideas. It is coloured through and through by
<i>feeling</i>, since both the situation itself and the organic
sensations of the emotive response are definitely pleasant
or unpleasant. It is, at any rate in its more intense
phases, insistently <i>organic</i>; we took the testimony of
language on p. 65, and you can easily add to the instances
there cited; though it must be said also that the
proportion of organic sensations to ideas varies greatly
from emotion to emotion and from individual to individual.
Finally, it is always a <i>predetermined</i> experience,
issuing from determining tendencies and moving forward,
in the given case, to a natural end; though here, too,
there is great variability, since the determining tendencies
to which the situation makes appeal may be almost
wholly instinctive, or may (as in the illustration we have
chosen) be partly instinctive and partly acquired.</p>

<p>The older books on psychology devote a great deal of
space to the <b>classification</b> of emotions; modern psychology
has rather been concerned to bring emotion
into the laboratory, and to trace the emotive pattern
under experimental control. It was natural to begin
with the simpler modes of feeling, and to proceed from
them to the more complex; and experiments were therefore
made on the sense-feelings. We have seen that the
results are not yet definitely assured (pp. 83 f.), so that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
is still too early to write an adequate psychology of the
emotions. On the whole, however, it seems that <i>the
three dimensions of sense-feeling will serve for a classification
of emotion</i>: joy and fear are agreeable and disagreeable
emotions, anger and grief are exciting and subduing,
hope and relief are straining and relaxing. It is
not difficult to carry this classification further; to find, for
instance, agreeable-exciting, disagreeable-exciting, agreeable-subduing,
disagreeable-subduing, even agreeable-exciting-straining,
agreeable-subduing-relaxing forms,
and so on and so forth; but nothing is gained, at
present, by drawing such distinctions. We shall therefore
leave the classification thus in the rough. One
point only calls for comment. We said that <i>emotion
is a suddenly aroused experience</i>, beginning abruptly and
dying down slowly; yet the straining and relaxing emotions&mdash;hope,
anxiety, disappointment, relief&mdash;seem,
on the contrary, to arise slowly and gradually. It is
difficult to be sure of the facts; but we must be careful
not to confuse the starting of an emotion with what
occurs after it has started. It may very likely grow in
strength; and it will follow, as we have said, a characteristic
course in time, until it reaches its natural end.
Either of these things&mdash;the growth in intensity or the
development in time&mdash;may give the illusion of a gradual
beginning. If we abstract from them, then it appears
that these straining-relaxing emotions really come
suddenly; they occupy the mind all at once; we shift
directly from grief to hope, from satisfaction to anxiety,
from fear to relief; the emotions may alternate in our
experience, but they set in abruptly. We say of a sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
friend ‘The doctor says that we may begin to hope,’
or ‘The relatives are beginning to be a little anxious’;
but as a matter of psychological fact the hope and the
anxiety appear to come and go, as mental patterns, quite
suddenly; the situation touches off, actualises, now the
one set of tendencies, and now the other. So our general
description of emotion may stand.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c218" id="c218">§ 50</a>. <b>The James-Lange Theory of Emotion.</b>&mdash;We
saw that emotion, at any rate in its intenser phases, is
insistently organic; the organic sensations readily
blend both with one another and with feeling; and the
resultant massive fusion is as characteristic of emotion
as the organic surge (p. 211) is characteristic of instinct.
Everyone can distinguish, even in imagination, the rushing,
swelling ‘feel’ of anger from the sinking, shrinking
‘feel’ of fear. Psychology has always had an open eye
for the organic constituent of emotion; Aristotle and
many later writers refer to it; and in France emphasis
upon the organic stir in emotion became almost a matter
of psychological orthodoxy. The whole subject was,
however, set in a new light when the late Professor
James propounded in 1884 his famous ‘theory of emotion.’
“My thesis is,” James wrote, “that the bodily
changes follow directly the <i>perception</i> of the exciting
fact, and that our feeling of the same changes as they
occur <i>is</i> the emotion;” “The more rational statement
is that we feel sorry because we cry, angry because we
strike, afraid because we tremble, and not that we cry,
strike or tremble, because we are sorry, angry, or fearful,
as the case may be.” The view thus paradoxically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
stated aroused much discussion; and it gained further
impetus by the publication in 1885 of an essay on emotion
by Carl Lange, professor of medicine in Copenhagen;
Lange independently comes to a conclusion which, in
principle, is the same as that of James.</p>

<p>James’ position is, evidently, twofold. He affirms,
in the first place, that <i>emotions have an instinctive basis</i>.
A situation is presented; the organism perceives it; and
immediately, directly, because the situation appeals to
instinctive tendencies in the nervous system, the emotive
response is evoked. With that statement we have no
quarrel. James also affirms, however, that <i>the ‘feel’
of what we have called the emotive response is itself the
experience of emotion</i>; having the organic sensations,
you have the emotion; if you had not the organic sensations,
there would be no emotion. In a later essay he
modified or amplified his position: he grants the presence
in emotion of ideas and of pleasant and unpleasant feelings,
but still maintains that the one thing characteristic
of the emotions is a general seizure of excitement, a churning-up
of the interior of the organism; and this rank
excitement is a matter of the organic sensations.</p>

<p>So there arise two questions of fact: <i>is emotion possible
if the organic sensations are lacking?</i> and <i>is the organic
fusion sufficiently differentiated, in the various emotions,
to give them their distinctive ‘feels’ in experience?</i></p>

<p>To answer the <i>first</i> question we have observations both
upon dogs and upon human beings. Emotive responses
“occur in dogs in which practically all the main viscera
and the great bulk of skeletal muscle have been removed
from subjection to, and from influence upon, the brain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
by severance of the vagus nerves and the spinal cord.
In these animals no alteration whatever was noticed in
the occurrence, under appropriate circumstances, of
characteristic expressions of voice and features, indicating
anger, delight or fear.” So far, then, the evidence tells
against the necessity of organic sensations. As regards
human beings, we cannot, of course, produce a visceral
anæsthesia at will, by operating upon the living nervous
system; we must wait until cases turn up in the hospitals.
Some such cases have been examined; and while the
observations made upon them are not conclusive, still,
they lend themselves more readily to the same than to the
opposite interpretation; if emotion is lacking, the lack
seems due rather to a general impairment of nervous
function, including that of the brain, than to the specific
loss of the organic sensations. The evidence as a whole
is thus unfavourable to James.</p>

<p>To answer the <i>second</i> question we may refer to the
results of experiments recently conducted by Professor
W. B. Cannon in the physiological laboratory of Harvard
University. “If various strong emotions can thus be
expressed in the diffused activities of [a certain division
of the nervous system]&mdash;the division which accelerates
the heart, inhibits the movements of the stomach and
intestines, contracts the blood vessels, erects the hairs,
liberates sugar, and discharges adrenin&mdash;it would appear
that the bodily conditions which have been assumed,
by some psychologists, to distinguish emotions from one
another must be sought for elsewhere than in the viscera.
We do not ‘feel sorry because we cry,’ as James contended,
but we cry because, when we are sorry or overjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
or violently angry or full of tender affection,&mdash;when
any one of these diverse emotional states is present,&mdash;there
are nervous discharges by sympathetic channels
to various viscera, including the lachrymal glands. In
terror and rage and intense elation, for example, the responses
in the viscera seem too uniform to offer a satisfactory
means of distinguishing states which, in man at
least, are very different in subjective quality....
The viscera are relatively unimportant in an emotional
complex, especially in contributing differential
features.” The technicalities of this quotation do not
here concern us; you will understand them if you read
Dr. Cannon’s book; but it is clear that, again, the evidence
is against James’ view.</p>

<p>We must conclude, then, that <i>the emotive pattern is a
more complicated affair</i> than the James-Lange theory
represented it to be. All the component processes&mdash;perception,
ideas, kinæsthesis, organic sensations, feeling&mdash;play
their part in the total experience. We must
conclude, too, that <i>the pattern varies, at least in the matter
of emphasis, from one individual to another</i>; that the processes
which ‘mean’ anger or fear to <i>A</i> may differ from
those which ‘mean’ the same emotion to <i>B</i>; the ideas,
the kinæsthetic set, the organic sensations, may be more
or less vivid, more or less extended, more or less stable
features of the mental pattern. In fine, we agree with
James that all emotions have an instinctive basis;
and we agree with him, further, that the organic commotion,
always present in some measure and degree, is
characteristic of the experience; but <i>we cannot regard
this organic commotion either as</i> <b>constitutive</b>, <i>as the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
thing necessary to emotion, or as</i> <b>differential</b>, <i>the one thing
that marks of any particular emotion from all the rest</i>.
From an æsthetic point of view we may regret this
conclusion; it is always more satisfactory to end up a
discussion with some positive, clean-cut statement than
to leave the subject with a ‘safe’ generalisation and a
balanced judgement; but when we are seeking scientific
truth, we may not outrun the facts we have; and when a
science is in the making, the facts will not often round off
prettily into a comprehensive theory.</p>


<p class="p2"><a name="c222" id="c222">§ 51</a>. <b>The Expression of Emotion.</b>&mdash;If the classification
of emotions is a pleasant exercise for authors of a
logical turn, the outward show of emotion in <b>gesture</b>
and <b>facial expression</b> has always been attractive to those
who pondered the relations of mind and body. It may
even be true that observation of these expressive movements
lies at the very root of psychology; for in emotion
a man is changed, transformed; he is unlike himself,
out of himself, beside himself; and what could suggest,
more plainly than such transformation, the activity of
an indwelling mind? However that may be, there is a
long list, stretching down the centuries, of works that
deal with emotive expression. We must ourselves pass
over everything that appeared before the time of Charles
Darwin.</p>

<p>Darwin, who was naturally anxious to bring the facts
of expression under his formula of evolution, began to
collect data as early as 1838; and with characteristic
thoroughness he went to all available sources,&mdash;to
animals, to the human infant, to the insane, to works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
of art, to the play of the facial muscles under the electric
current, to the different races of mankind. In his book
of 1872 he distinguishes three main principles of expression;
the titles will be understood from the examples.
The first principle is that of <i>serviceable associated habits</i>.
We all jump when we are startled, and wince when we
are threatened; and the jump and wince of man are
weakened survivals of the frightened animal’s leap out
of danger, and of its cowering self-effacement in presence
of a stronger enemy. The face of scorn, “curving a contumelious
lip,” lays bare the canine teeth, as if for actual
attack; the sneer of man is but a weakened survival
of the snarl by which our stronger-jawed ancestors unfleshed
their teeth for the combat. The second principle
is that of <i>antithesis</i>. If indignation shows itself (according
to the first principle) by squared shoulders and out-thrown
chest, the opposite of this aggressive indignation,
humiliation or self-abasement, shows itself in the opposed
attitude of raised shoulders and indrawn chest,
Shylock’s “patient shrug.” The third principle, lastly,
is that of the <i>direct action of the nervous system</i>. Thus we
all tremble from fear; and trembling is of no service,
often of much disservice, and cannot have been at first
acquired through the will, and then rendered habitual
in association with any emotion; it must be directly
due to the constitution of the nervous system.</p>

<p><i>Darwin’s principles have been much criticised</i>; in particular,
the purely negative principle of antithesis has
received short shrift from later writers. One of the
things that he fails to account for is the imitative play
of the lips. The disgusted man looks as if he were about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
to retch; the injured man looks bitter; the disappointed,
sour; the satisfied, sweet; the mouth, in these latter
cases, is set as it is when we have a bitter, sour, or sweet
taste. What is the reason? We may remind ourselves
that primitive language was concrete, and not abstract;
that it abounded in what we should nowadays call
metaphor. We may remember also that the one thing
necessary in a primitive society is food, and that primitive
metaphors would naturally be, to a large extent, metaphors
drawn from the preparing and obtaining of food,
from cooking and hunting. So we may imagine that the
successful hunter, returning to camp, licked his lips,
seemed already to be sucking the sweet morsel; while
the unsuccessful drew his lips out sideways, as if he were
trying to taste as little as possible of his sour draught.
In course of time the metaphor will lapse; or, more
strictly, the old concrete way of speech will give place to
an abstract phrasing, and will hold its own only <i>as</i>
metaphor, as a bit of picturesque imagery; we still talk
to-day of the sweets of love and revenge, of tasting
success, of tainted money, of a soured disposition, of
the bitter end. Meanwhile the original gesture, if only
it is fitted for communication, will persist unchanged;
gesture is far more conservative than language; and the
look of a bitter taste will thus express the emotion of a man
who is suffering, perhaps, under an unjust accusation.</p>

<p>We may say of all such attempts at explanation
what we said of the biological theory of feeling: it
would be foolish to reject them outright, and yet <i>they
are too general, too open to criticism, to satisfy the requirements
of science</i>. We need detailed work, both upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the physiological and upon the psychological side. Consider,
for example, the erection of the hair in fear and
rage. This is a result of the diffused activity of the ‘sympathetic’
nervous system, the total effect of which is to
<i>energise</i> the organism; when two boys are wrestling,
the friends of the weaker or less skilful shout to him to
‘get angry’; and terrified men achieve wonderful feats
of leaping and running. But how precisely does the contraction
of the muscles beneath the skin subserve this
energising? Is it an accident, so to speak, due merely to
the diffusion of the nervous activity? or has it a special
physiological function? and has it, further, anything of
the biological significance that Darwin attached to it?
Until such questions are answered in detail, we cannot
formulate general principles of the expression of emotion.</p>


<p class="p2"><a name="c225" id="c225">§ 52</a>. <b>Mood, Passion, Temperament.</b>&mdash;The weaker
emotive states, which persist for some time together,
are called <i>moods</i>; the stronger, which exhaust the organism
in a comparatively short time, are called <i>passions</i>.
No sharp line of distinction, however, can be drawn,
either as regards intensity or as regards duration, between
these various experiences.</p>

<p>We have special names for the <b>moods</b> which correspond
with most of the emotions; thus, cheerfulness is
the mood of joy, and depression the mood of grief.
As a rule, the mood appears suddenly, rises slowly to a
relative maximum, and then slowly dies down. You
wake in the morning, feeling irritable; you proceed to
take everything irritably, and so become more irritable
still; and after a while the incidents that prompt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
irritability seem to grow rarer, and the mood gradually
disappears. There are times, however, when some intercurrent
event brings about a quick and total change of
mood; and there are times when the mood passes off
abruptly, without assignable reason; you are surprised to
find yourself suddenly cheerful. It is a commonplace that
mood depends, in large measure, upon bodily health;
but the correlation has not been worked out.</p>

<p>Language also has many words for the <b>passions</b>: fury
is the passion of anger, terror the passion of fear. These
states imply a severe shock to the nervous system; and
though their first effect is to energise the organism, they
must soon exhaust its reserve powers; we notice, in
fact, that very violent emotions are likely to give way
to lassitude or even to unconsciousness. The name of
passion is further given, in ordinary speech, to any abiding
interest, natural (p. 207) or acquired,&mdash;to any mode
of emotive response that is specific and lasting. We say
that a man has a passion for success, for science, for gambling;
and we mean that a situation which shows any
sort of reference to these things will appeal to him,
dominatingly and one-sidedly, through that reference.</p>

<p>The word ‘temperament’ comes to us from popular
psychology, which classifies mental phenomena under the
headings of intellect, feeling and will, and places individual
endowment under the corresponding headings of
talent, temperament and character. <b>Temperament</b>,
so far as the term can be employed in a strictly psychological
sense, is thus <i>a very general term for the innate
susceptibility of the individual to emotive situations and
for the typical character of his emotive responses</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
doctrine of temperaments was first systematised by the
Greek physician Galen in the second century of our era,
though the germs of the current fourfold classification&mdash;into
choleric, melancholic, sanguine, phlegmatic&mdash;go
back much further in the history of thought. This
classification takes account of <i>the strength and the duration</i>
of the emotive response: the choleric person responds
quickly and strongly, the melancholic slowly and
strongly, the sanguine quickly and weakly, the phlegmatic
slowly and weakly, to the situation which evokes
emotion. Crude to the last degree! we say: and yet
it is astonishing to see what a master can do with such
crudity. Thackeray, in <i>The Newcomes</i>, has drawn
almost pure types of temperament; Madame de Florac
is melancholic, Fred Bayham is choleric, Mrs. Hobson
Newcome is sanguine, and Rosey is phlegmatic; and
the minor characters in a great many of our best novels
tend in the same way to personify the four temperaments.</p>

<p>But has not psychology advanced beyond this fourfold
classification? Not appreciably. There are books,
written by psychologists, on temperament and character;
but the resulting classifications, though more elaborate
and more ingenious, are also individually coloured;
nothing like finality has been reached. <i>A good deal
might be done, in this field, by the roughest kind of observation,
provided it were long enough continued.</i> If you kept
a diary for a couple of years, putting down the nature and
occasion of your emotions, and the nature and duration
and occasion and course of your moods, you would be
gathering material which psychology still lacks, and which
might serve as starting-point for detailed analytical study.</p>

<p class="psh">The ordinary way of speaking is, that the Understanding and Will are
two faculties of the mind; yet I suspect that this way of speaking of
faculties has misled many into a confused notion of so many distinct
agents in us, which had their several provinces and authorities, and did
command, obey, and perform several actions, as so many distinct beings:
which has been no small occasion of wrangling, obscurity and uncertainty
in questions relating to them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Locke</span></p>

<p>§ 53. <b>The Psychology of Action.</b>&mdash;There seems to be a
great gulf fixed between plants and animals, and you
were probably surprised to read, on p. 13, that there are
not a few psychologists who take the question of a
plant-mind with scientific seriousness. If you ask yourself,
now, wherein this gulf consists, you will find that it
reduces in the main to a single point of difference:
<i>the higher plants are stationary organisms, the higher
animals are motor</i>. The plant stands still and has to wait
for things to come to it; and its organisation fits the
case; it spreads its organs over the widest possible
space, and is all, so to say, on the outside. The animal
moves; it goes to things; and its organisation is correspondingly
different; the vital organs are packed away
inside, where they are out of harm’s reach, and are
distributed in such a way as to be easily carried. It
would be strange, then, if movement&mdash;the great differential
character of the animals&mdash;did not somehow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
fall within the range of psychology; and we know that it
does; for we are continually hoping, fearing, resolving,
refusing, wishing to <i>do</i> something, or feeling glad, sorry,
satisfied, disappointed, resentful that the something
has been <i>done</i>. Moreover, we have already made
frequent reference to movement; we have spoken of
the attitude of attention, of movement of the eyes,
of instinctive and expressive movements; and we have
also laid stress upon the manifold part played in the
mental life by kinæsthesis, by sensations from the moving
organs. So we are prepared to consider movement
in its own psychological right, as correlated with special
mental processes or patterns.</p>

<p>There are, as usual, a few preliminary matters to be
got out of the way. First of all, we shall do well to distinguish
the terms ‘movement’ and ‘action.’ Movement
is, without question, the wider term. Action, although
it is very loosely used in ordinary speech, so that
we speak of the action of a horse or a sewing-machine,
is the word that we naturally employ in referring to
human conduct. We may therefore take advantage of
this difference in meaning, and may say that <b>action</b>, as
a technical term in psychology, denotes <i>any organic
movement that has mental correlates</i>; or more strictly,
that it is an organic movement any phase of which,
beginning, middle or end, has mental correlates. The
need of the stricter definition will appear as we go on.</p>

<p>Secondly, we must be clear as regards the <b>problem</b>
which action, as thus defined, presents to psychology.
We have, of course, <i>to describe and to correlate</i>; to
describe the mental processes that occur with movement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
or with one or more of its phases; and to indicate, as
well as our knowledge permits, the corresponding processes
in the nervous system. We have made out
three modes of correlation: separate mental processes
correspond with certain brain-processes; the pattern of
mental connection corresponds with the play of associative
tendencies in the brain; and the course of the
mental stream corresponds with the activity of determining
tendencies. These, then, are the limits within which
we work; and we shall be obliged to leave the subject
very much in the rough; for psychological description
is still imperfect, and our knowledge of the nervous
mechanisms is woefully incomplete. Be clear, nevertheless,
that <i>the psychological problem lies within these limits</i>.
The psychologist has nothing to do with the relative
values of ‘motives.’ He cannot teach you how to acquire
‘control’ of your actions. His task is simply to
set forth the facts; and if the facts that he discovers are
of value for morals or education, as indeed they can
hardly fail to be, so much the better; only, you must
not confuse scientific information with practical advice,
and be disappointed at the one because you do not receive
the other. All this has been said before; but the
present is a good time for repeating it.</p>

<p>Lastly, you should realise that in an organism so complicated
as man, and of such varied and eventful history,
<i>movement by itself is no index to mental process</i>. There
are, no doubt, outward and visible signs of hesitation, of
deliberation, of quick resolve; but the bare movement
is not a cue to mind. Psychological enquiry must
always go <i>behind</i> the movement; that is, we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
either know the previous mental history of the individual
who makes the movement, or we must ourselves arrange
the circumstances under which the movement is to be
made. Suppose, for instance, that you have to sign
your name to a deed. You may have spent weeks in
reflection, in balancing pros and cons, in painful indecision;
your action is then a ‘voluntary action’
of the most positive sort; and yet, when the moment
comes, your signature flows smoothly from the pen, as
if the matter had never cost you a moment’s worry.
Now suppose that you are sitting in a committee-meeting,
listening to a tedious report; you take the blank
paper before you, and write your accustomed signature,
without either the intention to write or knowledge that
you are writing. The two movements may be indistinguishable,
and yet this second writing is an ‘automatic’
or ‘involuntary’ action. So a hand-shake may mean
the barest recognition of a casual acquaintance, or the
friendly settlement of a long-standing disagreement; the
onlooker can see no difference in the movements, though
their mental accompaniments are worlds apart. There
is, indeed, no chapter in psychology that illustrates <i>the
law of mental growth and decay</i> (p. 183) so fully and so
surprisingly as this chapter on action. Movements
that once were rich in mental correlates fall into the direst
psychological poverty; and movements that now are
poor may acquire a mental fortune, which they in their
turn are bound presently to lose.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c233" id="c233">§ 54</a>. <b>The Typical Action.</b>&mdash;Under these circumstances,
it sounds a little incongruous to talk of a ‘typical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>’
action. But we must start somewhere; and we
may, perhaps, say that the typical action, for psychology,
is <i>an action of the simplest form taken at its psychological
best</i>; in other words, an organic movement that is
<i>singly</i> determined and that shows a <i>maximum</i> of mental
accompaniment. You will understand better what this
definition means when we have worked out an illustration.
Meantime, you can see that such an action&mdash;we
call it an <b>impulsive</b> action&mdash;serves as point of departure
in two directions. The form may remain simple, while
the mental side suffers reduction; or the form may become
complicated, and therewith new mental characters
may be introduced. In the former case, the impulsive
action runs downhill toward automatic; in the latter,
it climbs up toward deliberative action.</p>

<p>Now for the illustration! Suppose that, as I am writing
this paragraph, it occurs to me to look up a reference,
for quotation, in a particular book that stands on the
shelf by my side. I turn toward the shelf, recognise the
book, take it in my hand and turn the pages, and presently
find the passage I had in mind to use. I have
performed <i>an impulsive action</i>, in the sense of our definition;
the illustration is complete. I shall go on to
put a marker in the book, or to copy out the sentence,
and ultimately I shall return the book to the shelf;
but these later developments do not here concern us.</p>

<p>Let us try to analyse this action; and since the mental
accompaniment is fairly complex, let us analyse, at first,
only in large and gross terms. We begin with a preparatory
phase, in which there are two things to notice:
the <i>intention to move</i> (it occurs to me to look up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
reference) and the <i>idea of the result</i> of movement (finding
the required passage for quotation). Then follows a
middle phase, in which the outstanding thing is the
<i>perception of the object</i> of movement (I see and identify
the book on the shelf). The final phase includes a
<i>perception of movement</i> itself in kinæsthetic terms (I
reach out, take the book down, turn the pages) and also
the <i>perception of the result</i> of movement (I find the
sentence). So we have three roughly distinguishable
phases, each one issuing from that which preceded it,
which we may formulate as follows:</p>

<table id="t03" summary="t03">

 <tr>
  <td class="tdl3">Intention of movement<br />Idea of result</td>
  <td class="tdc3">{</td>
  <td class="tdl1">→ Perception<br />of object →</td>
  <td class="tdc3">}</td>
  <td class="tdl3">Perception of movement<br />Perception of result</td>
 </tr>

</table>

<p class="p1">You understand that the arrows indicate a definite
direction; the second and third phases issue from the
first; <i>the whole course is predetermined</i>. When I perceive
the book, under this impulsive determination, the associative
tendencies have no freedom of play; I cannot
think that the back is breaking, or that I know the writer,
or that the chalky paper is detestable, though all of these
are things that might occur to me at another time; I
can only recognise the book as the book that will realise
my idea of result, that contains the passage I need.
The whole course, again, is singly, <i>unequivocally</i>, predetermined;
it occurs to me to use the quotation, and I
do not reflect or hesitate; I act directly and forthright
upon the suggestion; there is no conflict. In a word,
the example shows us action in its simplest form and with
a maximum of mental concomitant; and that is what
we agreed to regard, from the psychological point of
view, as a typical action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Analysis of this crude kind does no more than give us
our bearings. If we are to lay out the facts with scientific
accuracy, we must carry actions into the laboratory,
and examine them under experimental conditions.
We do this by way of the ‘reaction experiment.’</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c236" id="c236">§ 55</a>. <b>The Reaction Experiment.</b>&mdash;The reaction experiment
comes to us, of all unlikely things, by the road
of astronomy. In the old days, before electrical instruments
were invented, astronomers used to time the passage
of a star across the meridian of their observatory
by means of the <i>eye-and-ear method</i>. You can easily
imagine the procedure. You have your eye at the
ocular of a telescope, the field of which is evenly divided
by a number of fine vertical lines. The star enters the
field from the right, and crosses to the left; your task
is to determine the instant at which it traverses the midmost
vertical line, which corresponds with the meridian.
A clock is behind you, beating seconds; and you
count these seconds, one, two, three, from a given
starting-point. If the star passes the meridian exactly
on a beat, well and good; you know the time of its passage;
if, as ordinarily happens, it passes somewhere
between two beats, then you must estimate the time of
passage to the nearest tenth of a second. That is the
principle of the eye-and-ear method; you watch and
listen, and so make your observation.</p>

<p>In the year 1796, the astronomer in charge of the Greenwich
Observatory found himself obliged to dismiss an
otherwise competent assistant, who in the previous year
had fallen into the habit of recording his transits some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
half-second too late, and had now increased his error
to almost a whole second. This unfortunate man was
the originator of what came to be known as the <b>personal
difference</b>. For it was found that no two astronomers
exactly agreed in their recording of times; every observer
differed from every other by a certain average
amount. So it became customary to take some highly
skilled observer as standard, and to refer other observers
to him; and that is the origin of the <b>personal equation</b>;
the formula <i>A</i>-<i>B</i> = 0.8 sec. means, for instance, that the
observer <i>A</i> records a transit, on the average, four-fifths
of a second later than the more skilled observer <i>B</i>.
What <i>B</i>’s error may have been nobody knows.</p>

<p>We cannot trace the history of the personal difference
in detail. It is enough to say that the astronomers, having
discovered it, were naturally anxious to get rid of it;
and they presently found a way to relieve the observer of
the task of listening; he simply pressed a key when the
star crossed the line of the meridian, and the time of
pressing was recorded automatically. This device did
not eliminate the personal difference; but it was methodically
of great importance. For the eye-and-ear method
had now become, essentially, <i>a method of response to
stimulus by movement</i>; and in that form it settled down
permanently in the psychological laboratory. The
stimulus for the astronomer was the star on the meridian,
and the response was the pressure of his finger on a
key. But it is clear that the stimulus need not be visual;
the observer might just as well respond to a sound or a
touch or a taste. It is clear, further, that the response
need not be a movement of the hand; the observer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
may respond, just as well, by movement of the organs
of speech, or of the foot, or of lip or eyelid. It is clear,
finally, that if we know the actual time at which the
stimulus is presented, and the actual time at which the
movement of response takes place, we can measure
the interval between the two. A little ingenuity makes
this possible. If, for instance, the flash of light which
serves as stimulus <i>makes</i> an electrical circuit, and the
finger-movement in response <i>breaks</i> the circuit; and if
an electrical clock is placed in the same circuit; then the
clock-hands will begin to move when the flash comes,
and will stop when the movement occurs, and we can
read off the <b>reaction time</b> from the dial.</p>

<p>In its simplest form, then, the reaction experiment
takes shape as follows. We subject the observer to some
prearranged form of stimulation (a flash of light, a sharp
noise), to which he is to reply by some prearranged movement
(perhaps, the slipping of his finger from the button
of a telegraph key); and the instruments which we
employ are so connected that we can measure the time
elapsing between the exhibition of stimulus and the performance
of answering movement. The experiment thus
has two sides. It gives us <i>numerical results, the reaction
times</i> measured in units of our clock, in hundredths or
thousandths of a second; but it gives us also a <i>complete
impulsive action</i>, which we can observe as often as is
necessary for analysis.</p>

<p>For consider the course of the reaction experiment
in the light of our typical formula of action! The
observer sits down with the <i>intention of moving</i> when he
has perceived the stimulus; and he has an <i>idea of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
result</i> of his movement, namely, the performance of a
reaction experiment. The stimulus is presented; he
<i>perceives the object</i> of movement; and slips his finger
from the key. He thus <i>perceives the movement</i> itself,
and also, by the movement, <i>realises in perception his
idea of result</i>. He has performed a complete impulsive
action, but an action which, on the mental side, has
been thinned out to a manageable degree of simplicity.
The mental accompaniment is there; but the intention
to move bears upon a single finger, the idea of result is
just the idea of completing the experiment, the perception
of object is the perception of a simple stimulus, the
movement itself is a slight local displacement of a single
member; nothing is left out, although the action is
reduced to a skeleton. It has thus been made manageable;
the mental accompaniments of the movement
are not so complex that they baffle observation; and
the technique of the experiment is an outline which
can be filled in and further complicated in all manner of
ways. We may hope that that Greenwich assistant
found further employment; but we can hardly, as psychologists,
regret that he timed his transits later than
he should!</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c239" id="c239">§ 56</a>. <b>Sensory and Motor Reaction.</b> &mdash;Suppose that
you are performing the simple reaction experiment, and
that you tell your observers beforehand to react as soon
as they perceive the stimulus. You soon find that this
instruction is differently interpreted. One observer
will prepare to react as soon as <i>he perceives the stimulus</i>;
and another, <i>to react as soon as</i> he perceives the stimulus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
The difference of emphasis may be brought out by a
homely illustration. When the lights are turned on in
the evening, it is not uncommon, even in the best regulated
families, for a clothes-moth to start up from some
corner. You say ‘There’s a <i>moth</i>!’ and clap your hands
to kill it. But it escapes; and henceforth you do not
trouble to identify it; you clap your hands at anything
mothlike that flits across the field of vision; you are
set or disposed for the movement. So in the two forms
of the simple reaction: some observers tend naturally
to make sure of the stimulus, before they move, and
others tend naturally to move, as soon as any stimulus
has appeared.</p>

<p>We cannot rely, however, upon the natural tendency
of the observer, because his attitude is likely to change
as the experiment proceeds, and a change of attitude
means a disturbance of the experimental conditions.
Moreover, there are observers of intermediate tendency,
who accent <i>both</i> the ‘perception of stimulus’ <i>and</i> the
‘reaction as soon as,’ and may accent them in different
degree. Hence it is necessary to instruct the observers
at the outset that they are to perform either a <b>sensory</b>
or a <b>motor</b> reaction, that is, that they are to look forward
either to the perception of the stimulus or to the
execution of the movement. With this preliminary
instruction, the sensory reaction takes, on the average
and for practised reactors, a tenth of a second longer
than the motor, whether the stimulus be a sight, a
sound, or a touch. The longer time points, of course,
to a more complicated nervous path; and that in turn
raises the presumption of a richer mental accompaniment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Observations show, in fact, that <i>only the sensory
reaction represents a complete impulsive action</i>; the motor
reaction does not fall under our formula.</p>

<p>The main difference&mdash;and we have no space for
detailed analysis&mdash;is this. The instruction for the
<b>motor</b> reaction sets up kinæsthetic sensations of strain
in the reacting member, principally in the finger;
these are contextual processes (p. 118), which carry the
meaning ‘You are to react as quickly as possible’;
and they are accordingly known as ‘sensations of intended
movement.’ They imply that the instruction
is already in part fulfilled; the muscles are, from the
very first, prepared for the movement that shall end the
experiment. Indeed, an observer who is thus instructed
will sometimes react prematurely, before the stimulus
has appeared, and is also liable to accept as <i>the</i> stimulus
any chance stimulus that intervenes, and so to react
wrongly. The instruction for the <b>sensory</b> reaction, on
the other hand, sets up an expectation of the stimulus;
the organism is thus prepared especially for perception;
premature and wrong reactions do not occur. The
intention to move is present, to be sure, but it is in the
background, carried only by the feel of the finger as it
lies upon the key, or in more diffuse form by the feel of
the extended arm upon the table. We might therefore
say that, in the motor reaction, the formula tends to
close up on itself, like a telescope; idea of result is
always approaching perception of result, and intention
of movement is always approaching perception of movement;
the perception of object gets squeezed between
the two extremes, as these draw together; whereas, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
the sensory reaction, the formula is followed <i>in extenso</i>;
the mental processes are thinned out, as we have put it,
but they are all present, following one another in their
regular order. The reaction experiment thus renders
the impulsive action manageable, puts it at our disposal
for scientific analysis, but also shows that <i>an action,
even in its simplest form, will vary with every shift of
emphasis in the suggestion</i> (p. 213) <i>which calls it forth</i>.</p>

<p>Let us look, now, at the <b>reaction times</b>, and see if
they can be turned to scientific account. So many
experiments have been made that we know the average
times of reaction, both sensory and motor, to light,
sound and touch; and we also know what their average
constancy or regularity will be, if the reactor keeps
his attitude to the experiments unchanged. The times
themselves, and the numerical statement of their constancy,
may therefore be used as indexes to the type of
reaction, sensory or motor, and to the stability or instability
of the reactor’s attitude. <i>They embody, as if
in short-hand, the results of oft-repeated observation</i>, and
they may henceforth take the place of direct psychological
observation when we are asked to decide on the type
of reaction or the reliability of the reactor. The psychological
observation must, however, come first; we
cannot take the reaction-times of children or South Sea
Islanders, and at once put them down as sensory or motor
or mixed; we must know what the reactors were trying
to do, how they understood the instructions given them.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c242" id="c242">§ 57</a>. <b>The Degeneration of Action: From Impulsive
to Reflex.</b>&mdash;We have now to trace the course of impulsive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
action, downward to automatic, and upward
to deliberative action. If we start out on the downward
path, we note that impulsive action by frequent
repetition degenerates, first, to what is called <b>sensorimotor</b>
or <b>ideomotor action</b>: sensorimotor, if the object
is still <i>perceived</i>, as it is in the impulsive action proper
(p. 235), and ideomotor, if the perception is replaced by
an <i>idea</i> of object. Here the predetermination is a nervous
set without any mental correlates; the intention
to move has dropped away; and the idea of result is,
so to say, incorporated in the perception or idea of
object; so that movement follows at once upon this
perception or idea. When we sit down at table, for
instance, we take up our knife <i>as</i> a thing to cut food
with; and when we are dressing, we close our fingers
round a button <i>as</i> a thing to fasten a garment with; the
movements that we make are predetermined, but not
premeditated; the actions are sensorimotor. When,
again, it occurs to us, in the midst of our reading, that
the mail must have arrived, we ideate the packet of
letters <i>as</i> something to be fetched from the mail-box;
and when, as we watch the shower, it occurs to us that
the cellar hatchway is open, we ideate the hatchway <i>as</i>
something to be closed; we act without further thought,
and the actions are ideomotor.</p>

<p>But the degeneration may go further still. “There
is a story,” writes Huxley, “which is credible enough,
though it may not be true, of a practical joker, who,
seeing a discharged veteran carrying home his dinner,
suddenly called out ‘Attention!’ whereupon the man
instantly brought his hands down, and lost his mutton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and potatoes in the gutter.” Huxley calls this an <b>artificial
reflex</b> action; and indeed the organism responds,
in such cases of thorough drill, as fatally and automatically
as in the physiological reflexes, and with as little
apprehension of the nature of the stimulus; there is
nothing to choose, psychologically, between this direct
response to the word ‘Attention!’ and the blinking of
the eye in response to a threatened blow, or the snatching
back of the hand from a hot surface, or the withdrawal
of the foot when the sole is tickled. From the psychological
point of view, impulsive action, instinctive action
and artificial reflex all shade off into one another; and
the artificial and physiological reflexes are indistinguishable.</p>

<p>Only, as we know, <i>the artificial reflex has a mental
history</i>; the word ‘Attention!’ had been called out
many thousand times before it became a compelling
suggestion. What, then, of the <b>physiological reflex</b>?
Has it, too, a mental history, extending beyond the
individual to the race; is it a racially degenerate impulsive
action? or does it belong to a class apart, purely
physiological in character, and without right to mention
in a text-book of psychology?</p>

<p>The answer to these questions must be speculative;
and speculation, as is almost always the case, has swung
between opposed extremes. Some psychologists teach
that all action has its origin in the physiological reflex;
the organism at first moved reflexly, automatically,
fatally; and then, later, mental processes were somehow
‘imported’ into its activities. Others hold that all
organic movements were originally of the impulsive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
sort; the physiological reflex, so far from being primary,
is a late development, the final term in a series which
begins with movement of a large, diffuse sort, accompanied
by mental processes, and which ends with precise,
local movement devoid of mental correlates. Both
these views are open to objection from the biological
side; and it seems reasonable to suppose that <i>the earliest
movements of the earliest organisms were of two kinds</i>:
some were bare reflexes, or&mdash;to use the newer word&mdash;physiological
‘tropisms’; others, however scanty and
undifferentiated their mental accompaniment, were
still of the nature of impulsive actions. If this mediating
view be adopted, as a working hypothesis, the zoologist
and the comparative psychologist must join forces,
to trace the racial history of the physiological reflexes,
and to determine what part of our human equipment is
ultimately tropistic, and what part may be referred
back to earlier impulses.</p>

<p><i>The passage from an impulsive action to an artificial
reflex may be regarded, broadly, as an example of the effect
of practice.</i> We have seen that improvement in such
activity as piano-playing depends, not solely upon
repetition, but largely also upon changes in our method
of working; upon the sudden discovery of some new
trick of procedure, or the sudden release from some
hampering peculiarity of method (p. 170). Turning-points
of this same sort are characteristic of the path
from impulse to reflex; we do not find a gradual refining
of movement and a corresponding simplification of its
mental accompaniments; the history is rather a matter
of short-cuts and substitutions; the organic machine is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
too complicated, too sensitive, has too great a variety
of resources, to follow a beaten track. So the course
of impulsive action, though it be downhill, cannot be
expected to run smooth.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c246" id="c246">§ 58</a>. <b>The Development of Action: From Impulsive
to Selective and Volitional.</b>&mdash;Action appears in its
simplest form when it is singly or unequivocally determined
(p. 235); and this implies that actions of more
complicated form are multiply or equivocally determined.
What that means you will see at once if you
recall the development of attention. Primary passes
into secondary attention because we have many sense-organs,
all of them open to manifold stimulation at the
same time, and because we have many different lines
of interest, several of which may be appealed to by the
situation in which we chance to find ourselves; there
are rival claimants for the centre of the field of attention.
<i>Impulsive passes into</i> <b>selective</b> <i>action</i>, in precisely
the same way, <i>when the nervous system is the seat of a
conflict of impulsive tendencies</i>.</p>

<p>The passage, however, is not made at one step; the
conflict of impulses may remain a mere conflict of impulses,
without rising to the pitch of selective action.
We have already had an instance: the young child,
face to face with a strange dog, behaves as if pulled back
and forth by strings; it goes toward the dog, runs back
to its father, approaches the dog again, shrinks back
again, and so on. It has happened to the author, in
presence of the two impulses to shut a door on the right
and to seat himself at a desk on the left, to begin the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
right-hand movement towards the door, and then all at
once to slue around to the desk without having closed
it. In such cases, the organism acts impulsively or
instinctively, but acts nevertheless under a dual determination;
the instincts or impulses are in conflict.
Buridan’s ass, starving to death between its two bundles
of hay, illustrates the logical outcome of an exact equality
of the conflicting tendencies.</p>

<p>One may observe this sort of action, typically shown,
in the behaviour of those who are asked to guess a riddle
or solve a mechanical puzzle. Some people, of course,
set to work deliberately, and think the matter out in
all its bearings; they are not here in question. A great
many will behave in the manner just described; they
will hazard guess after guess in quick succession, and they
will snatch at one possibility of solution after another,
risking everything upon the impulse that happens to
be dominant at the moment, until they either light upon
the right principle or ‘give up.’ Professor Lloyd Morgan,
one of the best-known writers upon comparative
psychology, thinks that this <i>method of ‘trial and error’</i>
is characteristic of animal intelligence. The dog, for
instance, placed in novel circumstances, meets the situation
at once by some action that derives from his individual
experience or from racial inheritance; if that first
response fails, he ‘tries’ another action, similarly derived;
and so on, until luck favours him or he is diverted
to something else. Only man advances beyond the
stage of ‘trial and error’ to the level of rational selection;
and man himself need not; in the story of <i>Dite
Deuchars</i> Sir J. M. Barrie draws an accurate picture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
human conduct permanently arrested between impulsive
and selective action.</p>

<p><i>Selective action appears when the rival impulses are
so evenly matched that no one of them can find direct issue
in movement; it implies the state of secondary attention;
and it is possible only to organisms that possess free
ideas of memory and imagination,&mdash;probably, that is,
only to man.</i> Any biography that goes at all minutely
into details will furnish examples. Thus, when the first
Napoleon was at liberty to turn his thoughts to England,
after the treaty of Schönbrunn (1809), he found
two possibilities of action: he might himself take in
hand the conduct of the war in Spain, or he might devote
himself to heightening the rigour of the blockade in
the north and north-west. He ‘chose’ the latter
course; that is to say, he passed through a period of
doubt and hesitation, weighing the alternatives and
estimating results,&mdash;we know the pattern of secondary
attention,&mdash;until presently the stronger impulse won.
<i>It is always the strongest impulse that wins</i>; though here,
as also in the case of attention, it is not necessarily the
impulse that looks the strongest to psychological observation;
there may be a more impressive array of
ideas on the side that finally gives way. The winning
impulse, as we see in historical examples of selective
action, is that which has the strongest backing of nerve-forces
(p. 96). The actor, oftentimes, cannot make
his action plausible, even to himself, when he tries to
state his ‘reasons’; but the sympathetic historian can
trace the influence of tendencies which had no mental
correlates, and whose existence was therefore unsuspected
by their possessor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>All this is clear in principle, though psychology stands
sorely in need of detailed analyses. Let us add a final
word of caution,&mdash;that you beware of confusing the
practical or moral value of selective action with its
psychological status. Napoleon the Great was an incomparably
more efficient person than Dite Deuchars,
and the results of his action were incomparably wider;
but with a trifle more balance in the impulsive tendencies,
and a little freer play of ideas, the latter gentleman
could have performed selective actions of the same
psychological type as Napoleon’s.</p>

<p>There is, however, another kind of action&mdash;we may
call it <b>volitional</b> action&mdash;in which <i>an impulse seems to
come into conflict, not with another impulse, but with
some idea or group of ideas that has no motor reference</i>.
I hear my alarum-clock, and have the impulse to get
up; but that impulse is definitely opposed by the idea
of another half-hour’s sleep. How can an idea oppose
an impulse? When Cæsar crossed the Rubicon his
alternative was not another course of action, but the passive
resignation of the two Gauls and the disbanding of
his army; the choice lay between acting and refraining
from action. How can activity and passivity thus come
into conflict?</p>

<p>The answer to these questions is given with what we
said about the nervous correlates of attention (p. 109).
We learned, you remember, that <i>nervous reinforcement
and nervous inhibition go hand in hand</i>: neither acts
without the other; but we were not able at that time
to present the evidence for this belief. The evidence
is twofold. We find, in experiments upon <i>abstraction</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
that reinforcement always implies inhibition. Suppose,
for instance, that the observer is shown a series of coloured
figures, each one for a fraction of a second only,
and that he is asked to report accurately upon the form
of these visual stimuli. He can do so: but if he is then
asked to report further about the colour, he can say
little if anything in reply. Reinforcement of the form
has brought with it inhibition of the colour. We find,
again, in experiments with what is called <i>negative instruction</i>
that inhibition always implies reinforcement.
Suppose that a picture is shown, and that the observer
is told to utter the first word that occurs to him when
he sees it, only that the word uttered is <i>not</i> to be the
name of the object pictured. He can do this, too; but
the results prove that the ‘negative’ always brings in a
‘positive’; either the throat is held stiff, locked up
for the time against any utterance whatever, or the
instruction ‘Don’t name the object’ is translated by
the observer into ‘Name a property of the object’ or
‘Name a use to which the object might be put’; inhibition
of the name has meant reinforcement of throat-kinæsthesis
or of some positively suggestive idea.</p>

<p>Apply this evidence, now, to the case in point! The
sound of the alarum-clock is, on the face of it, a positive
suggestion, bidding me get up; but every suggestion is
really two-faced; if it sets off certain of the tendencies
natural to the situation, it also checks others. The
sound of the bell, therefore, not only reinforces the getting-up
tendencies, but also represses the nervous disposition
that tends to keep me lying still. In the same
way, the idea of further sleep means not only the reinforcement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
of this disposition to lie still, but also, on the
negative side, a blocking of the suggestion from the
alarum-clock. The situation offers the alternatives
‘action’ and ‘no action’; but the nerve-forces which
the situation calls into play, and which correspond with
these alternatives, both alike bear upon ‘action,’ as
both alike bear upon ‘no action.’ <i>The conflict is thus,
after all, of the same kind as in selective action.</i> Idea does
not oppose impulse, nor does activity oppose passivity;
but nerve-forces which make for action and against rest
oppose nerve-forces which make for rest and against
action; the double-faced nature of the nervous mechanism
is the key to the riddle. The particular ‘action’
and the particular mode of ‘no action’ are, naturally,
determined by the situation itself.</p>

<p><i>If these selective and volitional actions are often repeated,
choice is likely to give way to habit</i>; some one impulse
gains predominance over the rest; and then, as if to pay
the price of victory, speedily falls to the sensorimotor or
ideomotor form, and finally lapses into an artificial
reflex. When we are learning to play a musical instrument,
our actions are one and all selective; we have to
think which dot upon the staff stands for which note
upon the keys, and which finger is to be set down where.
When we have become adepts, the bare sight of the
printed score touches off the appropriate movements;
we play ‘instinctively’ in the right key, in the right
tempo, with the right emphasis; we may even carry
on a conversation, and still play correctly, though we
have never seen the score before. The practised speaker
does not ‘choose’ his words; his ideas express themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
for him; he may even run ahead in thought, while
his larynx is still busy with the present topic. The
road to automatism is that with which we are already
familiar (p. 245), though the psychological history of
the automatic actions is different.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c252" id="c252">§ 59</a>. <b>The Compound Reaction.</b>&mdash;The detailed analyses
that we felt the need of on p. 249 ought, by rights,
to be provided by the reaction experiment; for that,
as we said on p. 239, furnishes an outline-plan of experimental
work which can be filled in and complicated in
all manner of ways. Why, then, should not selective
and volitional action be as manageable as impulsive?
and why should we not follow, experimentally, the rise
of impulse to choice and its later return to impulse?</p>

<p><i>There are two main reasons, the one internal and the
other external, why the reaction experiment has not developed
along the lines of our psychological classification of
action.</i> The internal reason is that <i>the reactor is extremely
sensitive to slight changes in instruction</i>, in the
rules laid down for the experiment. We have already
had an instance: the sensory reaction is a skeleton impulsive
action; but the motor reaction, which results
from a shift of emphasis in the instruction, is not sensorimotor;
it is an abbreviated or telescoped impulsive
action. Psychologists have naturally been interested
in this side of the experiment, and so have tried the effect
of varying instructions, instead of duplicating in the
laboratory the gross types of action that our classification
distinguishes. The second, external reason is
that <i>the reaction, largely on account of its outside origin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
was for some time treated in a chapter apart</i>; not until
the nineties of the last century did psychologists realise
that it gave them experimental control of action; and
so the technique has been complicated and the outline
filled in without special reference to the psychology of
action. We need not here go into details; it is enough
to say that experimenters have tried the effect of increasing
the number of stimuli, and thus of leaving the reactor
more or less uncertain of what he shall expect; of increasing
the number of possible responsive movements; and
of varying the instruction given beforehand to the
reactor, in such wise that a particular responsive movement
is assigned to a particular stimulus, or that response
is made to certain stimuli but not to certain others.
<i>All these forms of compound reaction have an interest of
their own</i>, which makes their analysis desirable; they
enable us to trace the establishment and course of determining
tendencies, the tendencies set up by the
instructions; and some of them throw light upon the
psychology of negative instruction (p. 250). Only, as
we have said, they do not represent the different types
of action. Things are now changing; but a great deal
of work must be done before we obtain typical analyses
of the actions discussed in the preceding paragraphs.</p>

<p>In one respect, this historical severance of the reaction
experiment from the special psychology of action
has been of scientific advantage; it has left experimenters
free to employ the reaction method in any
connection in which it promised to be of service. <i>The
technique of the reaction experiment has, in fact, proved
useful in many investigations, in which the psychology of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
action is not involved.</i> Thus, we may measure the time
required for response at different levels of <i>attention</i>, the
time required (under various circumstances) for <i>recognition</i>,
the time required for the <i>discrimination</i> of sensations
whose stimuli are more or less alike, and so on.
There are a great many experiments into which this
feature of time-measurement may be introduced; and
when they have been often repeated, and standard times
have been determined, the times themselves and the
numerical statement of their constancy become psychologically
significant (p. 242); they indicate, in a sort of
short-hand way, what the observer has done and how
uniformly he has done it. One of the most valuable
extensions of the reaction experiment, from the practical
point of view, is the <i>association reaction</i>; words
are shown or called out to the observer, who replies in
every case by the first word that comes into his mind.
This experiment may be performed with abnormal as
well as with normal reactors, and the results are of importance
to the alienist. It has also been employed
with a view to the detection of crime: a series of words,
some of which bear upon the circumstances of the crime,
is presented to the supposedly guilty person, and the
time of his response to the critical words is taken as an
indication of his guilt or innocence. Under laboratory
conditions, with ‘crimes’ invented for the sake of the
experiment, some rather surprising results have been
obtained; but there have also been flat failures; and
no one can yet say positively whether the association
reaction will have its place in the legal procedure of the
future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>All these word-reactions move in the realm of meanings,
which are the practically important things; there
is no reason, however, why experiments of the kind
described on p. 161 should not be accompanied by time-measurements.
We have already suggested that moods
might be timed (p. 227); and it is possible to measure
the time required for the arousal of a sense-feeling, as
well as to note its duration. On the whole, therefore,
the reaction experiment or, as we may now term it, the
<b>reaction method</b> should play an even larger part in the
experimental psychology of the future than it has
played in the past.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c255" id="c255">§ 60</a>. <b>Will, Wish and Desire.</b>&mdash;The compound reactions
have led us into a digression. But, if the traditional
forms&mdash;the discriminative, cognitive and choice
reactions&mdash;are off the main track of the psychology of
action, they still throw light on the establishment of
determining tendencies to action, and in so far contribute
to the psychology of <b>will</b>. For will, taken in a
psychological and not in a moral sense, is simply <i>the
general name for the sum total of tendencies, inherited
and acquired, that determine our actions</i>; and we distinguish
different types of will, according as these tendencies
to action manifest themselves, characteristically,
in different ways. The man of strong will is one whose
tendencies are so deep-seated and persistent that he
attains his end, or at any rate continues to strive towards
it, however remote it may be and however numerous the
counter-suggestions that oppose it; and the man of weak
will is one whose tendencies are so instable that he is at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the mercy of every fresh suggestion that comes. James
remarks that, when the will is healthy, action follows,
neither too slowly nor too rapidly, as the resultant of all
the forces engaged; whereas, when it is unhealthy,
action is either explosive or obstructed: the mercurial
or dare-devil temperament shows an explosive will,
“discharging so promptly into movements that inhibitions
get no time to arise”; and the limp characters,
the failures, sentimentalists, drunkards, schemers, show
the obstructed will, in which “impulsion is insufficient
or inhibition in excess,” Divisions of this sort might
be pushed much further; but here, as in the parallel
case of temperament (p. 227), it is enough to indicate
the lines along which classification may proceed.</p>

<p>The terms ‘wish’ and ‘desire’ come to us from
popular psychology, and cover a great variety of actual
experience. If we are willing to speak somewhat arbitrarily,
we may say that a <b>desire</b> appears when some
particular tendency to action, which has present control
of the nervous system, is thwarted by external circumstances,
while the goal of action is still regarded as attainable;
and that a <b>wish</b> appears when some tendency to
action rises to momentary dominance, but is promptly
met by inhibiting tendencies, while the goal of action
is regarded as unattainable. This statement of the difference
between desire and wish will not fit every case,
for the reason that the terms are popular, and not technical,
and that their meanings are not sharply distinguished
either in ordinary speech or in psychology.
The experiences themselves, if we seek to compare them
with the experiences discussed in previous chapters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
approach most nearly to <i>sense-feelings</i>. Desire is a
straining-exciting, and wish a straining-subduing feeling;
and both desire and wish may be either pleasurable
or unpleasurable, according as the focal idea is the
idea of result, of the goal of action, or the idea of its
(present or permanent) inaccessibility. The existence
of these ideas, however, and the play of associative
tendencies which it implies, set desire and wish upon a
higher plane of mental development than the sense-feelings;
and the fact of direction, of the pressure of
determining tendencies, marks another difference between
the two kinds of experience.</p>

<p><i>This reference to sense-feeling reminds us of the doctrine,
common to the associationist psychology and to
modern popular psychology, that ‘pleasure and pain’
are the sole determinants of action.</i> Bain, for instance,
tells us that “the proper stimulus of the will, namely
some variety of pleasure or pain,” is always “needed
to give the impetus”; “that primary constitution,
under which our activity is put in motion by our feelings,”
remains unchanged through the whole history
of mind. Spencer, as we have seen (p. 86), regards it
as a corollary to the general law of organic evolution
that “pleasures and pains have necessarily been the
incentives to, and deterrents from, actions which the
conditions of existence demanded and negatived”;
our actions are always ‘guided’ by pleasures and pains,
immediate or remote. Leslie Stephen, who is in the
main a disciple of Spencer, writes in his brilliant <i>Science
of Ethics</i>: “pain and pleasure are the determining causes
of action; it may even be said that they are the sole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and the ultimate causes.” And, lastly,&mdash;though the
list of quotations might be greatly extended,&mdash;Professor
Sully asserts that “the prompting forces in our voluntary
action are feelings.”</p>

<p>It is true that there is oftentimes a close relation
between feeling and action; we gave some examples on
p. 231. It is also true, however, that there are numberless
actions into which feeling does not enter. The
associationist school have, therefore, fallen into a mistake
the opposite of that which we laid at their door on
p. 161; <i>as they look at the course of ideas in too intellectual
a way, so do they look at action in too emotional a
way</i>. They also repeat a mistake which we noted on
p. 146. There we found that an idea is supposed to
have a ‘power’ to recall another idea; Hume refers to
association as “a kind of attraction” which one idea
exerts upon another. So here the feelings are supposed
to have a ‘power’ to arouse or prevent or deflect actions;
they are used to <i>explain</i> conduct, precisely as the
laws of association are used to <i>explain</i> the course of
ideas. Both these theories <i>betray a misunderstanding
of the psychological problem</i>.</p>

<p>We must conclude, then, that the associationists are
at fault in their observation; for even if the earliest
impulsive actions (p. 244) were invariably preceded by
feeling,&mdash;and that is a matter of guesswork,&mdash;it is
still true that our present actions show no such uniformity.
We conclude, also, that the explanation of action
is to be found in the determining tendencies of the
nervous system, and not in the motive force of feeling.</p>

<p class="p1">(1) (<i>a</i>) It is said on p. 232 that “the present is a good time

Write a psychological formula for every kind. Where does
instinctive action come in?</p>

(<i>b</i>) every emotion is at the same time impulse; (<i>c</i>) every
emotion is at the same time instinct; (<i>d</i>) every instinct is
an impulse. What comment have you to make?</p>


<p>(7) What evidence can you offer for the hypothesis (p. 245)
that impulsive actions are, in the history of the race, as old
as tropisms?</p>


<p>(8) Suppose that you perform a selective action; the
action issues from a conflict of determining tendencies;
you ‘decide’ among various possibilities of action. Does
the decision always take place in the same way, or can you
distinguish ‘types’ of decision?&mdash;Do not hurry to answer
the question; keep it by you, and answer it in the light of
experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>


<p>(9) We saw that the motor reaction (which has its counterpart
in everyday life) is a telescoped impulsive action. Can
you mention any other kinds of action (also occurring in
everyday life) which do not find their precise place under the
headings of the chapter?</p>

with the reaction experiment, and should analyse a
number of reactions. Many instrumental outfits are on the
market; one of the simplest is President E. C. Sanford’s
vernier chronoscope (C. H. Stoelting Co.). When you have
familiarised yourself with the experiment, try to plan an
experimental study of selective and volitional actions.</p>

<p>§ 61. <b>The Nature of Thought.</b>&mdash;“The train of
thoughts, or mental discourse,” wrote Hobbes in 1651,
“is of two sorts. The first is unguided, without design,
and inconstant; in which case the thoughts are
said to wander, and seem impertinent one to another,
as in a dream. The second is more constant; as being
regulated by some desire, and design: and because the
end, by the greatness of the impression, comes often
to mind, in case our thoughts begin to wander, they are
quickly again reduced into the way.” Hobbes is here
distinguishing, so far as unaided observation allows
him, between the mental connections that reflect a random
play of the associative tendencies, and those whose
course is directed by some determining tendency. The
former, to be sure, are never wholly random; ideas are
grouped together by the situation in which they appear
(p. 165); and it is only fair to say that Hobbes himself,
in other passages, recognises this guidance. There is,
nevertheless, a marked difference between the two
kinds of ‘mental discourse,’ between (say) the casual
flow of conversation and the working out of an argument;
and it is the second kind, the progressive movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
of ideas towards an end, that modern psychology
has technically named <b>thought</b>.</p>

<p>You notice that we have spoken of a ‘progressive’
movement; and you notice that Hobbes writes a little
cautiously of regulated discourse; even in that, our
thoughts may ‘begin to wander,’ These are merely
different ways of saying that <i>thought goes on in the state
of secondary attention</i>; it is an experience of the same
general type as recollection, constructive imagination, selective
and volitional action. We therefore ‘think,’
in the technical sense, far less often than the popular
use of the word would suggest. For, on the one hand,
we accept a great many judgements, ready made, from
our surroundings; parents and teachers and friends are
constantly expressing opinions which we adopt without
question, opinions which they themselves have adopted,
for the most part, in the same unquestioning way. The
present generation takes the motor-car and the air-ship
for granted; it finds them natural and obvious; and
every generation falls heir to a body of social, political,
religious, æsthetic, and moral judgements which also
seem natural and obvious; thought is not needed, and
so is rarely undertaken. Secondly, even if we are
obliged to think, we still tend to think no further than
is necessary for the practice of life; we attain a certain
level of thought, in the mastery of our business or profession,
and there stop; the pattern of secondary attention
is replaced by that of derived primary attention.
<i>Most of our thought</i>, in other words, <i>is either borrowed
thought or routine thought</i>, that is, is not (in the psychological
sense) thought at all; independent, sustained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
original thinking is as rare as creative imagination or
as sagacious and farsighted action. In all probability,
it always has been rare; our ancestors probably thought
as we think, only a few with real seriousness, and they
only between whiles; but a very little thinking gives
man an immense superiority over the lower animals!</p>

<p>We have now to ask, first, about the <i>terms</i> in which
thought goes on; and we shall find that it may go on in
imaginal complexes, in words, and in mental attitudes.
We then discuss the <i>pattern</i> of thought; and we shall
find that thinking is characterised by the ‘division into
pairs’ which we mentioned on p. 205. Lastly, we shall
take up, separately, some of the special features of this
general pattern.</p>


<p class="p2"><a name="c263" id="c263">§ 62</a>. <b>Imaginal Processes in Thought: The Abstract
Idea.</b>&mdash;A great deal of controversy has raged about the
abstract or general idea. We can see to-day that the
name is, psychologically, a misnomer. Just as no idea
is, in its own right, an idea of memory or of imagination,
so also no idea is, in its own right, an abstract
idea; <i>an idea becomes, is made into, an</i> <b>abstract idea</b>
<i>whenever its context and determination carry the meaning
of abstractness and generality</i>. The associationists, however,
looked at things differently; they thought that
any idea which <i>means</i> ‘abstract’ must also itself <i>be</i>
abstract; and so they distinguished a special class of
abstract ideas. We obtain such ideas, they said, in this
way: we review a large number of particular ideas,
and we separate out the elements that are common to
all of them; this common remainder is then a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
or abstract idea which represents the whole group of
particulars. Thus, “by leaving out of the particular
colours perceived by sense that which distinguishes
them one from another; and retaining that only which
is common to all; the mind makes an idea of colour in
abstract which is neither red, nor blue, nor white, nor
any other determinate colour.”</p>

<p>An emphatic protest was raised against this theory
by the idealistic philosopher George Berkeley (1685-1753).
“The idea of man that I frame to myself must
be either of a white or a black or a tawny, a straight or
a crooked, a tall or a low or a middle-sized man. I cannot
by any effort of thought conceive [that is, mentally picture]
the abstract idea above described.” It is, truly, a
little difficult to <i>imagine</i> an abstract ‘colour’ with all the
specific colour-elements left out! Yet the theory is so
plausible, as long as process and meaning are confused,
that it has been revived again, though in somewhat
altered form. The suggestion has been made that an
abstract idea is a sort of <i>composite photograph</i>, a mental
picture which results from the superposition of many
particular perceptions or ideas, and which therefore
shows the common elements distinct and the individual
elements blurred. A passage from Huxley illustrates
this view. “An anatomist who occupies himself intently
with the examination of several specimens of
some new kind of animal, in course of time acquires so
vivid a conception of its form and structure, that the
idea may take visible shape and become a sort of waking
dream. But the figure which thus presents itself is
generic, not specific. It is no copy of any one specimen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
but, more or less, a mean of the series.” To which
we reply that ‘the figure which presents itself’ is as
specific and particular as any other idea; only, it <i>means</i>
the genus; the anatomist is working under the suggestion
of a type, of a composite picture that will make a diagram
in a text-book or monograph; and his idea is
abstract in virtue of this determination and context,
and not because it pictures the mean of a series.</p>

<p>The fact is, to repeat, that <i>any idea is made into an
abstract idea when context and determination carry the
meaning of abstractness</i>; and there is no doubt that, in
minds of a certain type, imaginal processes other than
words may take on this context and suffer this determination,
so that <i>thought may go on in imaginal terms</i>.
Experiments show that visual imagery may play its
part, along with verbal ideas and attitudes, in a single
train of thought; one recent writer describes visual
images of a complex kind as centres of ‘activity’ in
the progress of thinking. Blindfold chess-players, if
they are of the motor type, think of attack and defence
in terms of ‘lines of force’ which connect the various
pieces on the board, and which they themselves ‘feel’
in kinæsthetic imagery as pushes and pulls in hand and
arm. We saw on p. 77 that such general notions as
‘virtue’ and ‘commerce’ may come to mind in the
form of habitual images. No doubt, these images were
at first contextual processes surrounding a verbal idea;
they are therefore secondary, and not original; yet they
may now replace the verbal idea, and do duty by themselves
as abstract ideas. There are probably a good
many of us whose abstract idea of ‘triangle’ is simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
a mental picture of the little equilateral triangle that
stands for the word in text-books of geometry.</p>

<p><i>Is there, then, no truth at all in the theory of the composite
photograph?</i> Not an atom, so far as regards the
genesis of the abstract idea; one might superpose individual
ideas <i>ad infinitum</i>, and one would still have
nothing more than an individual idea. But if we leave
the abstract idea out of the question, and consider the
<i>history of ideas</i>, in minds of the imaginal type, then the
composite photograph has more to say for itself. For we
know from p. 156 that the associative tendencies, if left
to themselves, gradually die out; and that the weaker
die out more quickly than the stronger. Consider what
this means! I have a mental picture of a landscape,
and I do not see the actual scene for some years. The
picture fades out; but it fades out unevenly; its various
features are correlated with associative tendencies
of varying strength. So I shall always imagine a semicircle
of mountains with the valley opening towards
me, and the river meandering down the valley; for these
are features common to many landscapes and strongly
impressed upon my nervous system; but I shall lose
the relative heights of the mountains, and the particular
turns of the river, and the special distribution of villages
and churches; for these are individual features,
and have been less frequently repeated. <i>My mental
picture of the landscape thus approaches a type</i>; and the
same thing is true of all complex images, if they are left
to themselves, and the underlying associative tendencies
decay from old age. These typical images are, nevertheless,
ideas of particular scenes or things or faces;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
their rounding and smoothing do not make them abstract;
while, conversely, the image that carries an
abstract meaning may be as firmly outlined as a steel
engraving. The typical image depends upon the inherent
strength and weakness of associative tendencies;
the abstract meaning is due to determinations which
cut across the associative tendencies, perhaps to arrest
or short-circuit, perhaps to rearrange them; there can
be no necessary connection between typical image and
abstract idea.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c267" id="c267">§ 63</a>. <b>Thought and Language.</b>&mdash;It has often been
said that thought would be impossible without words;
and it is true that we can hardly conceive of human
thought save as formed and embodied and expressed in
language. Thought and articulate speech grew up, so
to say, side by side; each implies the other; they are
two sides of the same phase of mental development.
The old conundrum ‘Why don’t the animals talk?
Because they have nothing to say’ contains so much of
sound psychology; if the animals thought, they would
undoubtedly use their vocal organs for speech; and
since they do not talk, they cannot either be thinking.
All this is true: and yet we must acknowledge that
<i>thought is not necessarily wedded to speech</i>; it probably
appeared, at least in rudimentary guise, before words
came into being, and it persists (so to say) after words
have ceased to be. There is a gesture-language that
can serve as the medium of thought, and that is probably
older than speech; and there is a thinking in images
and attitudes that dispenses with words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>A <b>gesture</b> is <i>an expressive movement</i>; and all gestures
have their origin in the movements that express emotion.
But a gesture can serve as the medium of thought only
if it is <i>made with the intention to communicate</i>, to impart
some meaning; and it is this intention that seems to
be the important thing, the specifically human endowment;
though we can say nothing more of it now than
that it is one of the ingrained tendencies of our nervous
system (p. 135). Gestures, at any rate, can give rise
to a language of their own; and we may study this
language in various dialects; among deaf-mutes who
have not been subject to special training; in the Cistercian
communities, which are vowed to silence in the
ordinary affairs of life; among uncivilised peoples, like
the Indian tribes of North America; and finally in the
lower strata of civilised societies,&mdash;here the Southern
Italians are typical. There is a strong family resemblance
throughout. We find that gestures express both
the feeling-side and the idea-side of emotions; and we
find, naturally enough, that <i>development has gone further
on the side of idea</i>, where the gesture becomes a means
for the expression of thought. The simplest kind of
ideational gesture is the <b>demonstrative</b>, which points
towards, directly indicates, the object that excites emotion;
we point our finger at the thing that has frightened
us, or shake our fist at the man who has made us angry.
<b>Representative</b> gesture depicts the object: whether
by a finger-drawing of its outline in the air, or by the
reproduction of one of its characteristic features, or by
some purely symbolic movement. Thus, a deaf-mute
gesture for ‘smoke’ is a spiral action of the forefinger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
from below upwards; for ‘child,’ the action of cradling
and rocking the right elbow in the left hand; for ‘truth,’
the movement of the forefinger in a straight line from
the mouth. This gesture-language has its own syntax,
its own laws of growth and change, its own psychological
history; but it could not hold its own against articulate
speech.</p>

<p>The struggle was, in all probability, brief; because, at
the very beginning, <i>speech itself was a gesture</i>; the essential
thing about it was not the sound, but the movement.
If, then, gesture-language is older than speech, it can
hardly be much older; for the sound that accompanied
the gesture would soon attract attention, and the superiority
of articulate sound over visible movement would
soon be recognised. Attempts have been made, of course,&mdash;we
may say ‘of course’ at this point of our psychological
knowledge!&mdash;to read a meaning into the sounds
themselves. There is a theory which traces the origin
of language to the imitation of natural sounds, and so
makes it begin with words like <i>hiss</i> and <i>roar</i>; and there
is a theory which traces it to ejaculations and merely
mechanical utterances, and so makes it begin with <i>oh</i>
and <i>ah</i> and a sort of infantile babble. Neither of these
theories will hold water. Apart from the psychological
arguments, which we cannot here set forth, there is the
evidence of fact: words like <i>hiss</i> and <i>roar</i> form a very
small part of the vocabulary of any language; exclamations
and interjections are emotive and not ideational,
and have had but little development; and the babble of
the human infant is not primitive, but corresponds with
a stage in the maturing of an inherited speech-mechanism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
No! <i>the sound was, at first, simply the incidental
accompaniment of the gesture</i>, of a movement which included
the muscles of the larynx; it derived its meaning
from the gesture-context; and presently, under the
influence of continued social intercourse, it proved its
superiority to gesture and acquired its independence.
We may say in the large that <i>the word heard has never
had any other than a derivative and symbolic meaning</i>,
and that <i>the self-sufficiency of the word-gesture, combined
sound and movement, is the origin of language</i>.</p>

<p>What a word should ‘mean,’ therefore, depended in
the first instance upon the context and determination of
the articulated sound. Just as any idea may serve as
an abstract idea, so may any word whatever serve as an
abstract verbal idea, as what is technically called a
<b>concept</b>, provided only that its context and determination
carry the meaning of abstractness. We saw, however,
that the context of the abstract idea may drop
away, and the mental correlates of its determination
lapse, so that finally some conventional image, like the
triangle, is taken as abstract, wears the very stamp of
abstractness upon it. This is preeminently the case
with words. Every generation, we must remember,
inherits the speech of preceding generations; <i>language
comes to us ready made</i>. We learn from the study of
language itself that the abstract words were originally
concrete; thus the Latin <i>sapio</i>, to taste, <i>sapor</i>, taste,
are connected with <i>sapa</i>, must, <i>sapo</i>, soap, <i>sebum</i>, tallow,&mdash;with
the names of substances that are readily diluted
or liquefied; but the situations that made them abstract
dropped out of mind long ago. The child finds language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
waiting for it, and finds that every word incorporates
a meaning; and so it comes about, not only that the
mental representation of honesty or pride may be the
mere word, ‘honesty’ or ‘pride,’ as it occurs in internal
speech, but also that the same internal speech embodies
the meaning of abstractness; <i>the verbal image stands
psychologically for an idea and logically for a meaning</i>.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c271" id="c271">§ 64</a>. <b>Mental Attitudes.</b>&mdash;If you look back over a
course of thought, you will find verbal ideas, and you
will perhaps find imaginal complexes of various kinds;
but you will also find experiences of another sort, which
have come to be known as <b>mental attitudes</b>. They are
vague and elusive processes, which carry as if in a nutshell
the entire meaning of a situation. <i>Some of them
belong to the feeling-side of mind</i>: for feeling enters into
the train of directed thought no less than into the freer
play of association (p. 161): they are reported as ‘feelings’
of hesitation, vacillation, incapacity, expectancy,
surprise, triviality, relevancy, and so on. <i>Others are
more nearly related to ideas</i>; they are generally reported
by a phrase beginning with ‘I knew that ...,’ ‘I was
sure that ...,’ ‘I realised that ...,’ or some like
expression. Suppose, for instance, that the observer
is required to solve ‘in his head’ some mathematical
problem, or to think out the answer to some difficult
question that bears upon his special line of study. He
may say, in the course of his report: “At that point
it occurred to me <i>that</i> I had lost the first partial product,”
“It seemed to me <i>that</i> the whole thing was taking too
long a time,” “I suddenly realised <i>that</i> I had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
thought of that before,” “It flashed upon me <i>that</i> the
question was only another form of the old difficulty,”
“I could not see the answer, but I knew <i>that</i> I could
work it out,” and so forth. All these <i>that</i>-clauses may
stand for mental attitudes.</p>

<p>It is clear that, so far as the verbal expressions go,
the observer is reporting meanings and not processes.
Our task is, then, <i>to discover what processes lie behind
the meanings; and here the opinions of psychologists are
sharply at variance</i>. One party believes that the mental
attitudes are unique and simple, that they cannot be
further analysed, and that they must therefore be given
rank as mental elements alongside of sensation and feeling.
Another party, to which the author belongs, believes
that the attitudes are analysable, if only they are
taken out of the thought-context and examined by
themselves under more favourable conditions, and that
their analysis yields nothing else than sensations and
feelings. The whole matter is still under discussion,
and you will do best to suspend judgement. Meantime
we may look at a couple of instances.</p>

<p>Consider, first, the attitude of <b>expectation</b>. It is not
difficult to devise experiments which shall set up in the
observer an expectant attitude; thus, in a very simple
case, the experimenter might hang a weight by a cord
to the ceiling, tie a loose piece of string to the cord, and
light the end of the string; the observer would then
watch the progress of the flame, <i>expecting</i> that it will
presently reach the cord, burn that, and so cause the
weight to fall to the floor. What are the processes in
the observer’s mind as he watches? You will naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
think of an image; the observer will imagine the fall
of the weight. Not necessarily; not even usually;
<i>the image of expectation must go the same road as the image
of recognition</i> (p. 184). <i>Ordinarily, expectation consists
simply of kinæsthetic and organic sensations</i>; sometimes
there are verbal ideas; only occasionally is there an
image. If the experience is novel, <i>the sensations are
likely to be tinged by feeling</i>; there is a trace of
anxiety, of apprehension. Analysis reveals nothing
more.</p>

<p>We have, then, in expectation a <i>directed</i> experience;
the perception of the flaming string acts as a suggestion,
turning the observer’s mental processes into a single
channel. The kinæsthetic and organic sensations derive
in part from the bodily attitude of <i>attention</i>: tense
muscles, inhibited breathing, adjustment of the organ
of sight. Yet the observer is not merely attentive;
the suggestion, the determination is there; and the sensations
derive in part from that. They are <i>contextual</i>
processes, and carry the meaning that ‘so-and-so is
going to happen.’ They are therefore precisely like
the ‘sensations of intended movement’ that characterise
the motor reaction (p. 241); we might even call
them, following that analogy, ‘sensations of future occurrence.’
All the same, they are, if we regard them as
processes, just kinæsthetic and organic sensations, held
together in a certain pattern by the perceptive suggestion;
expectation shows nothing unique or ultimate
behind or beyond them.</p>

<p>In course of time, if the situation is repeated, the
feeling of anxiety fades away, and the experience becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
indifferent. With still further repetition, the
‘sensations of future occurrence’ also drop away; the
suggestion from the flaming string then sets the organism,
automatically, for the coming event; and the set
has no mental correlates whatever.</p>

<p>A like procedure might be followed with vacillation,
triviality, and the rest; and the outcome, in the author’s
belief, would be the same. It is less easy to attack the
<b>intellectual attitudes</b>, those expressed by <i>that</i>-clauses.
Suppose, however, that you have to write two letters:
the one to an intimate friend, dealing with your home-life
and things that have happened in your immediate
circle, and the other to a business correspondent, regarding
some contract that must be drawn up in precise
terms. Do you not sit down to write with <i>a felt
difference of bodily attitude</i>, almost as if in the two cases
you were a different organism? There are different
visceral pressures, differences of tonicity in the muscles
of back and legs, differences in the sensed play of facial
expression, differences in the movements of arm and
hand in the intervals of setting pen to paper, rather
obvious differences in respiration, and marked differences
of local or general involuntary movement,&mdash;all
of them deriving from the different suggestions or
determinations which prompt the letters. Here, then,
are two <i>thats</i>: ‘I was sure <i>that</i> he would be interested
in any gossip,’ and ‘I knew very well <i>that</i> I had to
write carefully’; and the processes that carry these
meanings seem, again, to reduce to a certain pattern
of kinæsthetic and organic sensations, tinged very
likely by feeling. <i>When observation reveals such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
wealth of sensory processes, it seems unnecessary to assume
a new mental element for the intellectual attitudes.</i></p>

<p>We saw on p. 4 that the concern of science is with
facts. But just because facts are the staple of science,
it is well that we should be a little jealous about them,
that we should scrutinise every alleged fact as severely
as our methods allow, and criticise it in the light of every
possible theory. That is the present condition of the
mental attitude; experiments are being made, and arguments
brought forward, for and against its novelty and
uniqueness; and the struggle must be carried through
to the bitter end; for only in that way can the truth
come stably to light. Meantime, those who are in the
fight must of necessity take a side; the onlooker, as we
have said, is well advised to await the issue.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c275" id="c275">§ 65</a>. <b>The Pattern of Thought.</b>&mdash;There is a broad
general <i>resemblance between the pattern of thought and
that of constructive imagination</i>; it has indeed been said,
though with exaggeration, that thought is an imagining
in words, and imagination a thinking in images. The
thinker, like the artist, sets out with a plan or design,
and aims at a goal; and thought, like imagination, is a
more or less steady flow, in a single direction, from the
fountain-head of nervous disposition. ‘Happy thoughts’
occur in thinking, as they occur in imagination; there
is a like movement between the poles of feeling; and
the empathic experiences of the artist are paralleled by
the mental attitudes of the thinker. In all these respects,
the pattern of thought repeats what has been said
on pp. 198 ff. of the pattern of constructive imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Thought, however, has its distinctive features</i>; for it is
subject to two of the great directive tendencies that we
mentioned on p. 205: the tendency to objectify, to find
‘real things’ in the world about us, and the tendency
to dual division. The <b>tendency to objectify</b> underlies
perception as well as thought; the earliest ‘real things’
were, we must suppose, external and material things;
but with the growth of ideas the tendency bears also
upon the things of mind, upon concepts and abstract
ideas; these are taken <i>as</i> real in every case of thinking.
The <b>tendency to dual division</b> is characteristic
of thought; thinking is essentially divisive, even if the
goal of thought is constructive. Here, then, is the main
difference between thought and constructive imagination:
that imagination proceeds to the exhibition of a
single something, a statue or a picture or a poem;
whereas thought proceeds to the exhibition of two somethings
in relation, and ends with what the logicians call
a <b>judgement</b>.</p>

<p>The tendency to dual division is so natural to us, and
is impressed so deeply in our nervous make-up, that we
can hardly hope to go behind it. We can hardly even
describe a situation which calls for thought without
presupposing the very tendency which is characteristic
of thought. For what are the situations? They are
<i>situations which ask a question</i>; and we cannot ask a
question without putting it in the form of a judgement.
Primitive man, wandering from place to place, comes
back to a scene that he knew under other circumstances;
the tree which was leafy is now bare, the river-bed which
was full of water is now dry. If there is no feeling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
familiarity, and therefore no recognition, the situation
may still <i>ask</i> him: ‘Same?’ and his reply ‘Same scene;
different features’ is the reply of thought. He has
tried to understand things; his secondary attention has
played upon the scene perceived and the scene remembered;
he has in the upshot divided the permanent from
the changing, the ‘thing’ from the ‘properties’ of the
thing; he has reached a conclusion, or formed a judgement.</p>

<p><i>All thought is of this kind, an answer to a question.</i> Let
us take the case of a scientific problem. Suppose that
flints, which bear the marks of human workmanship,
are found in a Pliocene bed, which has apparently
remained undisturbed. The geologist is called upon to
decide whether the deposit really has been undisturbed,
so that the ‘find’ is reliable evidence of the existence of
man in Tertiary times. The situation asks him a
number of questions: has the bed been misplaced by
faulting? can the materials have been brought to their
present position by water? are there any signs that
Quaternary man used the place? are the flints associated
with bones of Tertiary animals? and so on and so forth.
He forms a whole series of judgements; feature after
feature of the situation is attended to, and every one in
its turn is supplemented by ideas derived from previous
knowledge; there is the familiar conflict of secondary
attention, repeated over and over. Every judgement
affirms or denies some property of the situation, in
accordance with the original problem; and the outcome
of the series of judgements, of the whole train of
thought, is a final judgement,&mdash;still, of course, under
the determination of the problem,&mdash;‘this bed has (or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
has not) been disturbed’. If the flints themselves are
only doubtfully of human workmanship, then the situation
is doubly complicated; the questions and the partial
judgements are more numerous; but the general pattern
of thought is the same.</p>

<p>The tendency to dual division shows itself, then, in
the form of the judgement, in the opposition of ‘subject’
to ‘predicate’; it shows itself further in the grammatical
distinctions of substantive and adjective, verb
and object, verb and adverb. And <i>all thought or reasoning
seems to reduce, in the last resort, to a succession of
judgements which, under the particular suggestion or determination,
exhausts the possibilities of dual division</i>. The
duality, however, is not always obvious at first glance.
Ideas are involved; and the arousal of a particular idea
may mean the excitement of a whole nest of associative
tendencies; subject or predicate or both may thus be
supplemented in manifold wise; and the train of thought
may appear to be variously and irregularly divided.
Only a careful observation will show that these supplementary
processes derive, not directly from the suggestive
situation, but rather from the secondary excitement
of associative tendencies. Moreover, the judgements
themselves are not always explicit; they may occur
in nutshell form, as mental attitudes. <i>The tendency to
dual division is thus masked in two ways: by incidental
associations, and by attitudes.</i> It seems, nevertheless,
to underlie the whole structure of thought.</p>

<p>We are still in the dark as to psychological details.
We have evidence that there is no psychological difference
between an affirmative and a negative judgement;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
but we do not even know whether the judgement,
affirmative and negative, implies a specific mental pattern
of its own, as the idea implies the pattern of core
and context, or whether it may express a variety of
patterns. On the whole, the latter alternative seems
the more probable; <i>if there is any stable characteristic
of the judgement, it is not a definite pattern or arrangement
of mental processes, but rather a definite mental attitude</i>,
the ‘feeling of validity’; and this attitude seems to
be allied to the feeling of familiarity in recognition, and
so to be remotely akin to the emotion of relief. As far
as our evidence goes, it appears to accompany every
true judgement, that is to say, every judgement which
is formed in the state of secondary attention. A ‘feeling
of relation’ need not accompany the final judgement,
but is likely to crop up here and there in the course
of a train of thought, assuring us that certain things
go together, belong to the same ‘circle’ of ideas, and
that certain other things are contradictory, and cannot
go together. These <b>relational feelings or attitudes</b> are
contextual affairs, deriving probably from the kinæsthesis
of bodily attitude; they are, however, very difficult
to analyse, and their precise psychological nature is
still in dispute.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let us revert for a moment to the comparison
of thought with constructive imagination. We
have said that the two are broadly similar; and we may
now add that judgements occur in imagination, and
fetches of imagination in a train of thought. The differences
are, nevertheless, great enough to justify the
popular distinction of the two mental modes; for <i>thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
advances by repeated dissections of a situation which is
taken as real, while imagination realises in the work of
art a situation which at first was vague or fragmentary</i>.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c280" id="c280">§ 66</a>. <b>Abstraction and Generalisation.</b>&mdash;We have
spoken of the abstract or general idea, as if the two adjectives
were interchangeable; and <i>abstraction and
generalisation are, in fact, only two phases of the same procedure</i>.
When we abstract, we pick out the features
of a situation that are relevant to our present determination,
and neglect the other features. When we generalise,
we bring to light resemblances that have been merged
with differences; but this statement implies that we
neglect the differences, as irrelevant, and pick out the
likenesses, as relevant; generalisation is thus only a
special case of abstraction. We have seen that every
suggestion is double-faced, positive as well as negative;
and we may perhaps say that in thinking of abstraction
we emphasise the negative face, the discarding of the
irrelevant, while in thinking of generalisation we emphasise
the positive face, the bringing together of the similars
which are relevant.</p>

<p>Experiments upon <b>abstraction</b> may be made in the
manner outlined on p. 250: a complex stimulus (say,
a visual stimulus that shows differences of colour, of
number, of arrangement) is exhibited for a brief time;
the observer is asked to attend to some one aspect of
it (say, colour); and then, his report given, is asked to
state what he can of the other aspects (number and form).
Two general results may be mentioned. It is found,
as might perhaps have been expected, that <i>things which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
make the least appeal to attention are also the things most
easily overlooked</i>. Colour and form, for instance, are
more attractive than number; and when the observer
is told to attend to colour or form, number may go entirely
unnoticed; whereas, when he is told to attend to
number,&mdash;a relatively difficult task,&mdash;he is still able
to say something of colour and form. The result seems
only natural; but you may not see at once that it throws
scientific light on a matter of some practical importance.
We all know from sad experience that when thought, our
own or another’s, flows smoothly and easily, it is likely
to be superficial; the very smoothness of the flow means
that difficulties have been overlooked. The obverse of
this fact is, now, that if we struggle with the knotty
points of a subject, we get a grip upon the whole; the
interesting and attractive things take care of themselves;
their native appeal to the attention keeps them in mind.
So the experiments upon abstraction point a moral,
at the same time that they illustrate the nervous mechanism
of thought itself. They show, secondly, that <i>the
negative effect of abstraction varies in degree</i>; the aspects
of stimulus from which we abstract may be wholly
suppressed, so that no report at all can be made of them,
or may be apprehended indefinitely, so that the report
is general; thus, form may be correctly named, while
the colours are reported merely as ‘different,’ or as
‘dark.’ Another significant result! for it means that
<i>a concept is more easily touched off than a special name</i>;
we may fail to identify colours as red or blue when we
can still say that they are dark or different. The reason
is that the concept, the general name, is applied far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
oftener than the special name; its associative tendencies
are therefore both deeper seated and more numerous.
We have a parallel case in the image of p. 266, which
slowly loses its distinctive features and approaches a
type; and we have others in the gradual decay of memory
with old age: a grandfather may forget the names of
his grandchildren, but he does not forget that they are
‘boys’ and ‘girls.’</p>

</div>

<p>Experiments upon <b>generalisation</b>, that is, upon the
positive abstraction of similars, have been made by the
aid of meaningless forms,
grouped as in the figure.
The groups were of varying
complexity, but always
contained one common
element; and the
instruction given to the
observer was that he
should await the stimulus with as even as possible a
distribution of attention, and then, when the figures
appeared, should pick out the two that were alike.
No less than six modes of procedure were distinguished.
The observer might work actively through
the forms, one by one; this is a laborious method,
and was employed for the most part only in the early
experiments of the series. Or he might travel over
the groups, back and forth, until some figure struck
him as familiar; this is the method of simple recognition.
Or again he might start out on his journey
of exploration, and find himself suddenly arrested by an
insistent form, some figure that stood out more clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
than its fellows. Here are mixed methods, part active
search and part passive impression. In other cases,
the two forms stood out in quick succession, as if the
one had drawn the other after it; in still other cases,
the two similars stood out simultaneously, sprang
forth as if of their own accord. Lastly, in rare instances,
passivity reached its maximum; the observer looked
at the field, was at once held by some outstanding form,
and knew that this was the form required, although
he had not remarked the presence of its pair.</p>

<p>We cannot enter further into details; nor, indeed, is
the time ripe for discussion; the experimental study
of thought-procedures has hardly more than begun.
You see, however, that <i>the pattern of thought may vary
widely in certain of its features, while yet the outcome of
thought, the abstraction or generalisation, is the same</i>;
and this conclusion may help you to understand why there
need be no specific mental pattern for the judgement.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c283" id="c283">§ 67</a>. <b>Comparison and Discrimination.</b>&mdash;One of the
commonest occurrences in a train of thought is the comparison
of present with past, the harking back to a former
stage of the procedure in order to make sure that we
have not missed or mistaken some item of experience;
and one of the commonest tasks set in the psychological
laboratory reduces this comparison to its lowest terms.
Two stimuli are presented, in succession; and the observer
is required to say whether the intensity or quality
of the corresponding sensations, the duration of the
intervals, the magnitude of the forms, or whatever it
may be, is the same or different. Both the stimuli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
themselves and the time which separates them may be
varied in all sorts of ways; and the mental processes
involved in the comparison vary accordingly. Here
we shall mention only two points, which bear upon the
course of thought at large.</p>

<p>It is a tradition in psychology that the comparison
of present with past experience implies the arousal of
an <i>image</i>; we revive or reproduce the old, and then set
its mental picture alongside the new. We have met
a like tradition before, in our account of recognition and
of expectation (pp. 184, 273). Nothing, however, can
be more certain than that <i>the image is unnecessary;
comparison may be direct, the immediate outcome of a determination;
and if it is indirect, the processes involved need
not be images</i>. Suppose, for instance, that you are
comparing two tones, sounded in succession, and that
you are to report upon their pitch; you are to say
whether the second tone is higher or lower than the first,
or of the same pitch. In very many cases, the second
tone will evoke, at once and automatically, the report
‘higher,’ ‘lower,’ or ‘same’; you find yourself uttering
the word, without further experience of any kind;
the whole procedure closes in on itself, very much as
the impulse does in the motor reaction (p. 241). In
many cases, again, the comparison will be indirect,
but the intervening processes are sensations; strains
appear in chest or throat, in forehead or scalp; the observers
report a ‘tightening’ which means ‘higher,’
and a ‘relaxing’ or ‘slackening’ which means that the
second tone is lower. We may suppose that these
kinæsthetic processes are empathic; for in playing or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
singing or listening to music we are likely to strain and
hold the breath for high-pitched passages, and to relax
and settle down for the low. Lastly, some imaginal
complex may intervene; but even so it need not be auditory;
the observer may picture a printed score or the
piano keyboard, or may feel himself striking a note
which is a semitone above or below another. <i>The
auditory image plays a part in the comparison</i> only when
the experiment is novel, when the second tone fails to
touch off a response, or when there is a conflict of impulses
to report; in other words, <i>only when the observer
is hesitant and uncertain</i>; otherwise, it either fails to
appear, or appears and is disregarded.</p>

<p>That is the first point: the second is that <i>comparison
is often complete</i>&mdash;paradoxical as the statement
may appear&mdash;<i>before the second of the paired stimuli has
been presented</i>; we are ready with our answer before
the full question has been put. If, for instance, we are
comparing the intensities of successive tones, and if the
first tone strikes us as unusually loud, or as ridiculously
faint, then we are prepared to declare the second tone
‘weaker’ or ‘stronger’ before we have actually heard
it. We receive from the first tone an <i>absolute impression</i>
of loudness or faintness; and this impression&mdash;which,
as we saw on p. 125, is our nearest approach to
an intensive perception&mdash;suffices of itself to determine
our report. Logically, we may be said to ‘compare’
the very loud or very faint tone with a tone of average
intensity; psychologically, there is no comparison at
all, but <i>a direct response to the absolute impression</i> made
by the first term of the stimulus-pair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>It need hardly be said that these paragraphs do not
offer, even in outline sketch, a psychology of comparison;
they are not meant to; for here again the time is not
ripe for full discussion. They should be enough, however,
to drive home the lesson which the author intends:
that <i>the course of thought, whether we take the pattern as a
whole or consider separate aspects of it, is full of short cuts
and condensations</i>. It is probably as impossible to
unravel the psychology of thought, in every detail and
to its first beginnings, as it is to unravel the psychology
of perception. For our thinking is subject, not only
to the inherited tendencies of the nervous system, but
also to the stereotyped thought of our social surroundings;
we are bred up in an atmosphere of meaning, and
we hear words before we can speak them. If men do
not use language, as Voltaire cynically said they do, to
conceal their own thoughts, at least their facility of
speech makes the psychology of thought almost insuperably
difficult to their children.</p>

<p class="pc2"><a name="c287" id="c287"><b>Questions and Exercises</b></a></p>

<p class="p1">(1) We found, in the last chapter, that selective action
does not follow directly upon impulsive action, but that
there is between the two a stage of ‘trial and error.’ Can
you instance any form of thought (from your own experience,
or from drama or fiction) which corresponds with the stage
of trial and error in action?</p>


<p>(2) Can you suggest the circumstances under which an
‘intention to communicate’ might naturally arise? Your
answer must be speculative; but it must also be scientifically
reasonable!</p>


<p>(3) How is articulate speech superior to gesture? Write
fully; do not be satisfied with your first answer.</p>


<p>(4) Illustrate in detail, from your answers to previous
questions in this book, the advantages and disadvantages
of language as the vehicle of scientific description.</p>


<p>(5) In this chapter we have seen that speech replaces
gesture; in § 51, we spoke of the conservatism of gesture,
and said that the speech-metaphor might lapse while the
gesture persisted. Is there any contradiction?</p>


<p>(6) It is said that the letters of the alphabet were originally
hieroglyphics, that is, pictures of actual objects in the
external world, and that they have only by very slow degrees
become sound-symbols. Suppose this to be true: can you
outline the course of change, in psychological terms?</p>


<p>(7) Try, as occasion offers, to analyse (<i>a</i>) the mental
attitude of questioning, and (<i>b</i>) the feeling of validity;
keep your notes by you, and try again and again. Compare
your own results with those obtained by your fellow-students.</p>


<p>(8) James writes that “we ought to say a feeling of <i>and</i>,
a feeling of <i>if</i>, a feeling of <i>but</i>, and a feeling of <i>by</i>, quite as
readily as we say a feeling of <i>blue</i> or a feeling of <i>cold</i>” (Principles
of Psychology, i., 1890, 245 f.): that is to say, we ought
to speak of ‘sensations of relation,’ just as we speak of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
‘sensations of sight.’ Do you agree? Answer the question,
first, in general terms, from the point of view of a scientific
psychology; and again in the concrete, after you have
observed the mental processes that come with an emphatic
<i>but</i> or <i>if</i>.</p>


<p>(9) An examiner sets questions which shall test his
students’ knowledge; he also sets questions in order to discover
whether they have thought for themselves. How
can he tell?</p>


<p>(10) How is it that one can carry a complicated sentence to
a smooth grammatical conclusion, without knowing beforehand
what words and what form of sentence one is going to
employ?</p>


<p>(11) Arrange an experiment on comparison with simultaneously
presented stimuli; an experiment, for instance, on
the discrimination of hues or of lengths of lines. Outline
a psychology of this mode of comparison. Is the comparison
always direct? Is there any evidence of absolute impression?</p>


<p>(12) On p. 259 you were asked to distinguish various
types of decision; and some of them, as you no doubt found,
were <i>not</i> decisions in the proper psychological sense. Can
you, in the same way, distinguish types of conclusion, and
show that some of them (even after secondary attention
has been at work) are not, in the proper psychological sense,
judgements?</p>

<p>§ 68. <b>The Nature of Sentiment.</b>&mdash;In ordinary speech,
the word ‘sentiment,’ like the word ‘feeling,’ is used
in many different senses; and, unlike ‘feeling,’ it has
not settled down to a single meaning within psychology.
We must therefore define it arbitrarily; and we shall
reserve it, in this book, to denote <i>the feeling-complex
which gathers about a judgement or an imaginative construction</i>.
In emotion, we are brought face to face with
an incident or situation which overwhelms us, takes
possession of us; the emotion arises in the state of
primary attention. A very strong and complex feeling
is formed, and is rendered still stronger and still more
complex by the organic sensations that come with our
bodily attitude towards the situation (p. 216). In
<b>sentiment</b>, we are also brought face to face with an
incident or situation; but this is of a kind that demands
secondary attention, effortful and divisive attention,
now to one phase or feature and now to another. We
take possession of it, so to speak, in place of its taking
possession of us. Otherwise, the sentiment resembles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the emotion; a complex feeling is formed, and is reinforced
by organic sensations; the bodily expression of
sentiment is of the same kind as that of emotion. Suppose,
for instance, that we sit down to a book by a new
author. If we are actively and not passively interested;
if we read critically, in the light of previous study and
present knowledge; if we judge as we read; then our
<i>felt realisation</i> of the aptness, fitness, rightness of the
author’s style is a sentiment. Or suppose that we are
looking at a painting by a great master. If we can
see how form and colour flowed straight out of the brush;
if we can appreciate this fluency as the reward of toil
upon toil, essay after essay; if our own critical vision
can seize the painter’s idea, and note the individuality
with which that idea was conceived and is now expressed;
then our <i>felt realisation</i> of the beauty of the painting is,
again, a sentiment. These are examples offered from
the standpoint of the critic; and such examples come
naturally to mind, since criticism is both commoner and
more articulate than creative art; but it need hardly
be said that the artist too, as his construction proceeds,
will have the same sort of experience, and probably in
more intensive form.</p>

<p><i>The sentiment thus stands upon a higher level of mental
development than the emotion</i>; there is no other difference.
And it follows from what we have said of thought
(p. 262) that <i>the sentiment is a rare experience</i>. Just as
there are many apparent judgements that are not
really thought at all, so there are many apparent sentiments
that are based upon borrowed judgements, and
have never been anything more than feeling-attitudes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
more or less explicit; and just as secondary lapses into
derived primary attention, so will a true sentiment lapse,
with time and repetition, into a feeling-attitude. Hence,
in describing and identifying the sentiments, we must
be constantly on guard against confusing them with
attitudes based on ready-made judgements, and with
attitudes based upon what were once true judgements
but are now matters of habitual acceptance. Our
‘sentiment’ of honour, for example, may never have
cost us a moment’s attention. A definition of honour
has come to us, by tradition and precept, and we have
accepted it without thought; situations which involve
honour take possession of us, as emotive situations do,
and we reply by the feeling-attitude. Or again, our
‘sentiment’ of beauty in pictorial art may once have
been a real sentiment; we may have laboriously studied
art-canons, have studiously dissected art-forms by
secondary attention, have steeped ourselves in appreciation
and criticism. Now, after all this labour, we
have nothing but an attitude to a new picture; we
‘instinctively’ approve or disapprove of a work of art,
without making any positive effort to analyse it. To
talk, in these cases, about a moral or an æsthetic sentiment
would be psychologically wrong; we experience
simply two feeling-attitudes.</p>

<p>If, then, psychology were concerned simply with the
part played in the mental life by the sentiments proper,
the subject might be dismissed in a few words; the
sentiments would figure in a text-book of psychology very
much as the ‘rare earths’ figure in an elementary chemistry.
We cannot thus dismiss them, and for two reasons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
In the first place, <i>the experience of a true sentiment</i>,
in any one of the great departments in which sentiments
may appear,&mdash;we shall mention them presently,&mdash;<i>leaves
behind it a remarkably varied train of feeling-attitudes</i>;
and these attitudes are thenceforward a permanent
possession; we give illustrations in § 69.
Secondly, <i>the experience of a sentiment, and the possession
of the consequent variety of attitudes, enable one empathically
to realise the attitudes and responses of those who, in
other departments, have reached the same mental level</i>. Not
only is there a ‘freemasonry among artists’; there is
a freemasonry among all men and women who have at
any time really judged or constructed; so that the radical
reformer and the conservative reactionary, the
austere moralist and the disciple of art for art’s sake,
feel at home with each other, can get to close quarters
with each other; their ideas and beliefs may differ as
the east differs from the west, but&mdash;if they have honestly
wrestled with their problem&mdash;there is a felt psychological
community between them. The great writer
who goes by the name of Anatole France has brought
out this truth, in his own ironical way, in the quotation
which heads the chapter. So that individually and
socially the sentiments demand consideration; the
attitudes which derive from them enrich and diversify
individual experience, and establish a social bond of
empathic understanding among those who would else
be psychological strangers.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c293" id="c293">§ 69</a>. <b>The Variety of Feeling-Attitude.</b>&mdash;Let us take
an elementary example of the variety of attitudes which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
follows in the wake of a sentiment. The sentiment
which we select is one of those most widely attained:
the <i>sentiment of fitness of literary style</i>. If, now, you
read Lafcadio Hearn’s <i>Japan</i>,&mdash;as who has not?&mdash;you
cannot fail to notice the differences of paragraphing.
There are paragraphs which follow one another in the
ordinary way, without break. There are paragraphs
separated by a blank space, the width of a line of print.
There are paragraphs that begin with a dash. There
are paragraphs separated by a line or triangle of asterisks.
There are paragraphs which end with a series of periods.
And these modes of connective separation, as we may be
allowed to call them, are themselves variously combined.</p>

<p>Hearn has tried by such rather clumsy means to
arouse in his reader the specific feeling-attitude in which
he wrote. He tries to do the same thing, on a more
minute scale, by his system of punctuation; and the
net outward result is an unpleasant spottiness of page.
Let us, however, keep to the internal; and let us consider
only the paragraphing. If you pause to think of
it, the paragraph-feeling itself is a somewhat subtle
thing; a properly rounded paragraph gives you a feeling
of temporary completeness, while yet it invites you
to look ahead, leaves you in a certain suspense; a
poorly finished paragraph gives you the same feeling
of disappointment, of being ‘taken in,’ that you get
from a weak ending to a stanza, or from a musical progression
that fails to hold its tone-colour. The paragraph
that is set off from what follows by a blank line
rouses a feeling of greater completeness; you are to
stop and take breath, to let your thought play backward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
a little before you go on; still you are to look forward.
The paragraph that begins with a dash opens up
the subject from a new angle; you are to hold what
you have read, but you are now to see it in a fresh light;
the feeling is that of a pleasurable curiosity, with the
prospect of reference forth and back. The paragraphs
with asterisks between them are like different roads
of survey in a country that you are touring; each one
is complete in itself, but you are to remember them all
for a future synthesis; at the moment you have a sense
of relief, but this is mixed with a somewhat exciting
responsibility; the author expects you to be ready for
him when he comes to summarising. Lastly, the train
of periods means a trail of feeling; the device, which is
far more freely used by French than by English writers,
invites you to let your thought play ahead a little, in
the context of the feeling aroused by the paragraph,
before you go on. Take the description of the local
Shint[=o] festival: “By immemorial custom the upper
stories of all the dwellings had been tightly closed: woe
to the Peeping Tom who should be detected, on such a
day, in the impious act of <i>looking down upon the god</i>!...”
Elementary enough, in all conscience; and needlessly
emphasised by the italics; and yet tremendously
effective; one’s ideas trail off, in a context of feeling,
from the seacoast village of Japan to the inland English
town, from outraged godhead to the desecration of
humanity; not sentimentally, or one has missed the
writer’s intention, but in a continuous train of attitudes
which derive from literary sentiment. It is a pity,
psychologically, that ‘sentimental’ is the adjective of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
‘sentimentality’; for sentimentality is at the opposite
pole to sentiment, as sentiment is here used; but we
cannot help the twists of language.</p>

<p>No doubt, a greater artist than Hearn would have
printed his pages in the conventional way, and would
still have made his appeal, without signposts, to the
expert reader. Yet we may be grateful to him for a
psychological object-lesson; he has given outward
expression to a set of attitudes that we should otherwise
have been obliged to seek and identify for ourselves.
All the same, the attitudes would have been there, as
certainly and definitely as if they had been indicated;
and we could have found them, if we had ever experienced
the sentiment of literary fitness. You see what
enrichment of the life of feeling such a sentiment breeds,
and you see how helpless we should be without it. The
proverbs say <i>de gustibus non est disputandum</i>, and <i>quot
homines tot sententiæ</i>, as if taste and opinion were matters
of the merest chance. They are never that, however
far they may lie below the level of sentiment and judgement;
for there are solid uniformities of sense-feeling,
and there is in every society a basal community of
ideas; while, upon the higher level, they are as sure and
as uniform as individual differences of talent and temperament
allow. They are far more sure and far more
uniform than the outsider imagines; technical discussion
and technical appreciation have always a reasoned
foundation of agreement. Competent critics may debate
whether Whistler’s picture of his Mother or that of
Miss Alexander is the greater portrait; but think how
much must be agreed upon before the debate can begin!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c297" id="c297">§ 70</a>. <b>The Forms of Sentiment.</b>&mdash;Emotions go in
pairs; an emotion is either joy or sorrow, either hope
or fear; there is no midway emotion that is something
between the two, but is neither the one nor the other.
The sense-feelings, too, go in pairs; a feeling is either
exciting or subduing, for instance, and cannot be anything
between. When, however, the situation that
arouses feeling is met by us in the state of secondary
attention, then there is a third possibility; and <i>the
sentiments, in fact, run in threes</i>. Here is a theory: is it
true or false? If we judge it true, we have the sentiment
of <i>belief</i>; if we judge it false, the sentiment of <i>disbelief</i>.
But we need not come to a final judgement; facts <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>,
<i>c</i>, we will suppose, tell for the theory, and facts <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i> tell
against it; we oscillate, uncertainly, between the two
predicates ‘true’ and ‘false’; and the result is the
suspensive sentiment of <i>doubt</i>. Language is an unsafe
guide in these matters; partly because the same term
may stand both for sentiment and for feeling-attitude,
but partly also because the sentiments, being less common
than emotions, have not always received specific
names. In principle, nevertheless, there is in every
case a third sentiment, corresponding with oscillation
of judgement, between the two extremes.</p>

<p>The three just mentioned, belief-doubt-disbelief,
belong to the class of <b>intellectual</b> sentiments. An attempt
has been made to examine them under experimental
conditions; with the result that they prove to be of
rare occurrence; that they are characterised in different
minds&mdash;as might perhaps be expected, from the complexity
of the situation&mdash;by different complexes, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
the kinæsthesis of bodily attitude, by internal speech,
by the interplay of visual imagery; and that they are
ordinarily replaced by the feeling-attitudes of certainty
and uncertainty. The mental patterns of belief and
disbelief turn out to be the same; and this result is
psychologically reasonable; for the positive and negative
of the terms are logical, an affair of meaning; so far
as experience goes, disbelief is as positive as belief.
Hence it is natural that both of them should be represented
in feeling-attitude by the same ‘certainty,’
Another group of intellectual sentiments, less often
named, but familiar to everyone who has set to work
seriously to master a new writer or a new subject, consists
of <i>agreement, obscurity and contradiction</i>. These
have not, to the author’s knowledge, been subjected to
analysis; indeed, the present paragraphs can do little
more than catalogue a few of the more obvious sentiments;
the experiences are difficult to induce, and their
detailed study is yet to come.</p>

<p>In the sphere of the <b>moral</b> or <b>social</b> sentiments, we
have such opposites as trust-distrust, honour-dishonour,
justice-injustice. There is always a suspensive sentiment,
corresponding with oscillation of judgement,
though its name can be made only approximative; we
may, perhaps, speak of trust-trial-distrust, honour-ambiguity-dishonour,
justice-equivocalness-injustice; think
yourself into concrete situations, and you will get the
meaning of the terms! Social situations are, however,
of great practical importance; and we usually meet
them, not by a sentiment, but by some emotion based
upon instinctive tendencies; vanity, shame, pride,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
sympathy are emotions of this sort. The same thing
holds of <b>religious</b> situations. Triads like faith-perplexity-denial,
communion-insecurity-estrangement point
to the state of secondary attention; but in general the
religious situation sets up an emotion.</p>

<p>We come, lastly, to the <b>æsthetic</b> sentiments. These
are confused, by the majority of civilised mankind, with
the emotions aroused by the <i>subject</i> of the work of art;
whereas this subject is really of very minor importance;
of no importance at all, if it is dictated by tradition
and environment; and of secondary importance, only
as it is chosen by the artist, from a number of possible
subjects, because it allows the expression of personality
or offers a test of difficulties overcome. What do you
suppose Michael Angelo was trying to do when he painted
the <i>Last Judgement</i>, or Titian when he painted the <i>Entombment
of Christ</i>? The æsthetic sentiments are, in
reality, those of success-bafflement-failure, ease-confusion-difficulty,
approbation-criticism-condemnation, and
the like. When Ruskin said “Everything that Velasquez
does may be taken as absolutely right by the student,”
the unmeasured approbation expresses a true
æsthetic sentiment; Ruskin had <i>worked</i> over Velasquez.
When a recent writer on art directs us, in Millet’s
<i>Gleaners</i>, to “these forms bowed down by labour,
these coarse habiliments, these work-hardened hands,”
he is outside the sphere of æsthetics altogether, and his
appeal lies&mdash;at the best&mdash;to a social emotion.</p>

<p><i>These groups of sentiments, the intellectual, the moral
or social, the religious and the æsthetic, are usually regarded
as distinct and different.</i> It is true that they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
called forth by different kinds of situation. We must
remember, however, that <i>there are only two kinds of
mental pattern involved</i>: the thought-pattern and the
pattern of constructive imagination; and we have seen
that these are themselves broadly similar. It is not
likely, therefore, that the sentiments, or the feeling-attitudes
that derive from them, differ in anything but
inessentials from group to group; M. Bergeret and M.
l’abbé Lantaigne felt in very much the same way. The
variety of the feeling-attitudes is, indeed, surprisingly
large; the point here is that this variety is essentially
the same, whether one be sage or saint, artist or moralist.</p>


<p class="p2"><a name="c300" id="c300">§ 71</a>. <b>The Situations and Their Appeal.</b>&mdash;If we wish
to enquire into the nature of <i>the situations which arouse
a sentiment</i>, two courses are open to us. We may undertake
a study of origins; we may trace the history of
primitive science and primitive art, and so on; and
we may then try to generalise, both as regards the circumstances
which called forth the scientific or artistic
response, and as regards the appeal that such circumstances
make to the human organism. Or we may turn
our attention to acknowledged masterpieces, and try
in like manner to ‘get behind’ them; trusting in this
event rather to the typical than to the general. Both
courses have been followed, and followed assiduously;
but the outcome is still uncertain.</p>

<p><i>The tendency has been to refer a group of sentiments
to some single root in human nature.</i> That is only natural;
for it is always satisfactory to simplify; and when once
the investigator has hit upon what he takes to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
primule or germ of later development, he is prepared
to accept whatever makes for his theory and to reject
whatever tells against it (p. 98). Yet we must remind
ourselves that man’s instinctive tendencies are not carried
intact throughout his history; man reasons, as we
said (p. 210), on the basis of fragments of instinctive
tendency, disjoined from their original connections and
recombined to suit the occasion. <i>We may, for instance,
refer the intellectual sentiments to a native curiosity</i> (p. 205);
but what is curiosity? A very mixed medley of instinctive
responses: Professor Thorndike includes under
it “attention to novel objects and human behaviour,
cautious approach, reaching and grasping, the food-trying
reactions of putting in the mouth, tasting and
biting, general exploration with the eyes and manipulation
with the hands,” as well as “the love of sensory
life for its own sake.” Again, <i>we may refer the moral and
social sentiments to a native sympathy or empathy</i>; but
here, also, we should find, in the concrete, a mixed medley
of particular responses. These references are, nevertheless,
fairly satisfactory. What shall we say of religion
and art?</p>

<p><i>There seems to be no original artistic tendency or art-instinct.</i>
In primitive times, the body was decorated
with a view to attracting notice, and especially to attracting
a mate. Then, by slow degrees, decoration travelled
from person to surroundings: first, from the body to the
clothes, and then again from clothes to house. But
as the primitive house is a rude structure, and its owner
poor, not much can be done by way of individual house-adornment;
and so we find the members of a tribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
clubbing together, so to speak, to decorate the common
house, the temple. Æsthetics now enters into the service
of religion.</p>

<p>Again: as the tribes settled down to agricultural pursuits,
man became a labourer and learned to work;
systematic and regular work grew to be a necessity.
But work means play; if we labour, we must also have
recreation. How, then, shall grown-up people play?
They have lost their interest in childish games. Æsthetics
comes to the rescue; art is the play, the proper
recreation, of grown-up workers; we speak, and speak
rightly, of Shakespeare’s ‘plays’ and of ‘playing’ the
violin. Æsthetics has now lost its distinctively religious
meaning, and has been turned to secular purposes.</p>

<p>In no less than three ways, therefore, has æsthetics
proved itself to be of practical importance. It has been
useful in courtship; it has been useful as enhancing the
impressiveness of religious ceremonies; it is still eminently
useful as the play of adults. <i>Curiosity and empathy
have both entered into it</i>; curiosity in the manipulation
of shells and feathers, of brush and cutting edge; empathy
in the affairs of courtship and worship. Further
than this we can hardly go. The psychological essence
of tragedy, in Hamlet or Antigone, and the psychological
essence of comedy, in Dogberry and Verges, still escape
us; there are many theories, but no one of them is
convincing.</p>

<p>It seems, also, that <i>there is no specific religious tendency
or instinct</i>. Religion has been ascribed to fear,
to an instinct of dependence, to an instinctive recognition
of the infinite, and so on; but modern writers agree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
that it cannot derive from a single source. “Religion,”
says Professor Leuba, “is rooted in instinctive
impulses and in instincts,&mdash;in fear, acquisitiveness,
pugnacity, curiosity, love, etc. But the relation that
instinct bears to religion is no other than that obtaining
between instinct and commerce or any complex social
activity.” Religion, like art, has a strong practical
sanction; the worshipper expects to control the forces
of nature, and to secure the action of gods and spirits
upon human minds and bodies; while religion itself
satisfies the desire for power and for social recognition,
quickens intelligence, and regulates and unifies the
community. We understand something of the growth
of religious ideas, as we know something of the development
of art; but the contents of a religious system, and
the products of artistic construction, do not take us far
towards the explication of human tendencies.</p>

<p>In a word, then, the problem which we have here
formulated is too difficult for solution now or in the near
future. We cannot ‘get behind’ the masterpiece, the
achievement of civilisation; the conditions are too
complex. We cannot draw any certain conclusion
from the study of origins; for primitive man, as we
know him, is very like ourselves, both in convention
and in reasoning; Professor Boas finds no evidence that
“hereditary mental faculty has been improved by civilisation”;
the savage may be untutored, but he is as
complicatedly human as the best of us. We can say,
negatively, that <i>neither the situations which are met by
sentiment nor the tendencies to which these situations appeal
are unique</i>; and that is, in itself, something gained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
No genuine problem is insoluble; and further work,
partly along the older lines and partly perhaps by new
methods which bear directly upon man’s instinctive
tendencies, will some day answer the questions raised
in these paragraphs.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c304" id="c304">§ 72</a>. <b>Mood, Passion, Temperament.</b>&mdash;With lapse
of secondary attention, the sentiments lapse, as we have
seen, into feeling-attitudes. It appears, from ordinary
observation, that they may also persist, in weakened
form, as <b>moods</b>. Thus, the moods acquiescence-indecision-incredulity
correspond with the sentiments belief-doubt-disbelief;
and we speak of a critical humour, a
religious frame of mind, and so on. It is doubtful
whether the sentiments rise to the intensity of <b>passion</b>;
we speak, it is true, of a passionate humility, of a passion
of disapprobation or of renunciation; but it is probable
that these experiences are emotive, singly and not
multiply determined.</p>

<p>A detailed classification of the <b>temperaments</b> would
include forms characterised by special susceptibility
to sentiment and by type of response, intellectual, artistic,
and so forth. Meantime, the crude fourfold arrangement
of p. 227 seems to cover the cases: the ascetic
temperament, for instance, falls under the melancholic,
the critical under the phlegmatic, the ‘artistic’ of current
speech under the choleric or sanguine.</p>

<p class="pc2"><a name="c305" id="c305"></a><b>Questions and Exercises</b></p>

<p class="p1">(1) What do you mean by ‘style’? Do not write commonplace;
think the question out, and answer it in psychological
terms.</p>


<p>(2) Have some argumentative passage read aloud to you.
Notice how the intellectual feeling-attitudes rise and disappear,
as the argument proceeds. Differentiate them, and
try to give them names; mark the sentences which call them
forth; try to determine if their nature and arousal correspond
with the writer’s intention.</p>


<p>(3) What modes of feeling-response may be aroused by
music? Illustrate, if possible, by actual examples.</p>


<p>(4) Are there any movements that characteristically express
certain sentiments, as clenching the fist (for instance) expresses
anger?</p>


<p>(5) Matthew Arnold defined poetry as “a criticism of life”
(look up the passage, in the Preface to Poems of Wordsworth,
and be sure that you understand it!). Does this definition
suggest any further field of usefulness for æsthetics? May
æsthetics properly be extended to cover it?</p>


<p>(6) How does ‘curiosity’ differ from ‘inquisitiveness’?</p>


<p>(7) Can you recall any characters, in literature or fiction,
who might stand as embodiments of some social or religious
sentiment?</p>

<p>(8) Two traditional explanations of the ludicrous are
(<i>a</i>) the theory of degradation: that when we laugh we are
realising our own superiority, and (<i>b</i>) the theory of incongruity:
that the comic situation always involves a nullifying
of expectation. What criticisms can you offer?</p>


<p>(9) What sort of temperament are we thinking of when we
agree to call Shakespeare, Cervantes, Goldsmith, Sterne,
Lamb, Dickens and George Eliot ‘humorists’?</p>


<p>(10) Aristotle lays it down that tragedy “accomplishes
by pity and fear the purgation of such emotions.” Can
you read a positive and definite meaning into this statement?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Can you rephrase it, in terms of our psychology of sentiment?
Is it then adequate?</p>


<p>(11) How do we know that a greater artist than Hearn
would have printed his pages in the conventional way?
What means has an author, who does print in the conventional
way, of emphasising the points at which he wishes
feeling-attitudes to arise?</p>


<p>(12) You should analyse some sentiments at first hand.
Ask a friend to write out a number of descriptions, statements,
questions, that have evoked in his own experience the sentiments
(say) of belief and doubt, or of honour and ambiguity.
Let him arrange them in pairs: belief-doubt, honour-ambiguity.
Then take a pair, and read the two statements in
quick succession. You will be surprised to find how matter-of-course
and indifferent your attitude is; but presently
some member of a pair will grip you, start you thinking; and
you will then have the opportunity to observe. Write out
(or better, dictate) a full report.</p>

<p>§ 73. <b>The Concept of Self.</b>&mdash;We said on p. 9 that
the word <i>mind</i> is used by the psychologist as an inclusive
name for all the phenomena of the psychological world,
that is to say, of the world <i>with man left in</i>. We then
found, on p. 10, that the <i>man left in</i> reduces to a functional
nervous system. This means, of course, that
there are as many psychological worlds as there are
separate nervous systems; so that <i>the</i> psychological
world, which the psychologist tries to describe, is in
reality an average or generalize world; though the
observations upon which his descriptions rest are always
made upon this or that particular world. The same
thing holds of any science. A boy picks up a bit of
jagged stone, and with a jerk of his wrist flips it across
the road. No physicist could tell you the exact course
described by that stone, and no physicist wants to.
Physics deals with the ideal course of ideal projectiles
hurled under fixed conditions; the boy and the jerk
and the jagged stone are all generalised away into some
mathematically smooth trajectory. The observations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
of physics, on the other hand, are made by men working
under conditions that are not ideal, and using instruments
that differ from the wrist and the stone only in
degree, not in kind; the smooth curve is derived from
data all of which have their margin of empirical error.</p>

<p>Psychology, however, just because it has to do with
a world in which man himself remains, is in a different
case from the physical sciences; it has to take account
of the <b>self</b>. <i>The concept of self is not solely psychological</i>;
it is a common-sense concept; and like all the constructions
of common sense it has three sides, philosophical,
practical, and scientific. It is <i>philosophical</i>, in so far
as it involves an attempt to explain or to rationalise
the facts of observation; and it evidently does that;
the notion of self is a way of explaining the continuity
of memory and of conduct; I remember my past because
I am I, and I behave in this way or that because it is
‘like me’ to do so. The concept is also <i>practical</i>;
common sense rates a self as gifted or energetic or lazy
or improvident; it is always valuing or estimating some
Him or Her, some You or Me. It is further <i>scientific</i>,
that is, psychological; for the self thus rated is some
particular combination of talent, temperament and
character, and the continuity which the self explains
is some particular mental constitution, intellectual,
emotive, active; one cannot at all define the ‘person’
or ‘individual’ of common sense without using psychological
terms. So that psychology, if only in self-defence,
must have its say in the matter, and must recast
the self from its own point of view.</p>

<p>The recasting is not difficult. <i>A self, in the psychological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
sense, is one of the particular psychological worlds.</i>
It is not mind, but <i>a</i> mind, the mental phenomena correlated
with a particular nervous system, and arranged
and determined in accordance with the tendencies of
that system. We have made no mention of it hitherto,
in this book, because our main business has been with
general psychology, and we have had no need of it.
Psychology, however, does not confine itself to the
generalised world: and that is how it comes to be in different
case from the physical sciences, and takes account,
not only in self-defence, of the concept of self. If you
go back to pp. 31 f., you will note that there is a <b>differential
psychology</b>, a psychology of individual differences, as
well as a general psychology. The variation of mental
processes from observer to observer, and the limits and
manner of this variation, are indeed just as much matter
of observable fact, and therefore just as proper a subject
for scientific enquiry, as their uniformity; and as
the incidents of a man’s career may be set forth objectively,
without praise or blame, in a biography, so may
his psychological self, his mental processes in correlation
with his nervous system, be set forth in a <b>psychography</b>.
We ourselves, although we have been occupied with
general psychology, and have for the most part spoken
of ‘practised observers’ as a physicist might speak of
‘a sensitive galvanometer,’ without going into particulars,&mdash;we
ourselves have, nevertheless, found frequent
occasion to mention individual differences. The
facts that we have thus touched upon incidentally are
worked up, systematically, by differential psychology.</p>

<p>The concept of self is, however, a common-sense concept;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
it has, as we have seen, its practical side; and
you will understand, therefore, that <i>the differential study
of selves has a high practical importance</i>. Such a study
is not rigorously or exclusively psychological. But
since certain ‘mental traits,’ and certain combinations
of them, may render a man fit or unfit for a proposed
business or profession, it is important to know in what
degree these traits are present; and here the psychologist
is of assistance; he has helped to devise ‘mental
tests’ which serve to identify and measure them. It is
also especially important to know what traits are likely
to be found together, and in what degree. This problem
has been vigorously attacked, of recent years, on
the side of intellect; and while the details belong to a
chapter in practical psychology (p. 33) which we cannot
here open, there is one result, at any rate, which
should find a place in a scientific text-book. There
seems to be no doubt that <i>the individual nervous system
possesses, over and above its special habits, susceptibilities,
tendencies, and activities, a characteristic manner of functioning
at large</i>; so that a <b>common or general factor</b>
enters into all the special intellectual responses that
are called forth by particular situations. It is not easy
to make this result clear to the reader, mainly because
no one has as yet a clear idea of what the common or
general factor is; we have good evidence that it exists,
but we can say very little more about it. Different
names have been given to it: ‘energy of attention,’
‘general ability,’ ‘intellective energy,’ ‘general intelligence’;
but they indicate the way in which it manifests
itself, and not its own nature; the best name for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
present is the vague ‘general common factor.’ We do
not know, either, upon what it depends: on blood-supply,
perhaps, or on the arrangement of nervous structures,
or on some individual ‘quality’ of the nervous elements,
or perhaps on something else that we cannot even guess
at. What it does is to hold a man’s intellectual traits
together and to enter into the exhibition of them all;
<i>it is thus, from the psychological point of view, a sort of
supreme determining tendency, guiding all mental processes
whatsoever into the channels of intellectual selfhood</i>.
Whether there is a like general factor on the emotive
side, and whether ‘emotive energy’ is of the same kind
as this ‘intellective energy,’ cannot be said.</p>

<p>One further point! We have been careful, in dealing
with the common-sense concept of self, to distinguish
its three aspects, philosophical, practical, scientific; but
<i>we have drawn the limits of this self more strictly than
everyday usage warrants</i>; and we must now correct that
error. Common sense, as we remarked on p. 2, is
likely to confuse the Me with the Mine, and the Him
with the His; the self is extended from personality to
possessions. The confusion of Him and His is a natural
consequence of the practical reference of the concept;
the easiest way to rate or estimate another person is to
consider his property, his sphere of influence, his social
prominence; and these things, which are a part of the
other person’s value, thus become for us a part of himself.
The confusion of Me with Mine has a different
origin. Intellect, temperament and character are based
upon habits, and habits imply an habitual surroundings;
we are ‘not ourselves’ when we leave our accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
groove. No doubt, each of these sources of confusion
intermingles with the other; we are not concerned, however,
to follow them in detail.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c312" id="c312">§ 74</a>. <b>The Persistence of the Self.</b>&mdash;A full account
of the self of common sense, in so far as this self calls
for psychological treatment, belongs to social and not
to general psychology; and the discussion therefore
falls outside the scope of the present book. We must,
however, say a word about that <i>observed continuity of
memory and conduct</i> which the concept of self, on its
philosophical side, professes to explain (p. 308); for
the notion of the <b>persistence of the self</b> has had a marked
influence, as we shall see in § 75, upon this chapter of
general psychology.</p>

<p><i>We are all of us disposed to take the persistence of the
self for granted.</i> Do I not now remember what I did and
thought and felt when I was a small child? and do I not
now act in accordance with my character, as family and
friends expect me to act? Surely the thing is obvious:
the organism is physically continuous, from infancy
to old age; a likeness of interest, of skill, of aptitudes,
may be traced from childhood to manhood; and the
discovery of the ‘general common factor’ in the intellectual
sphere only confirms what we knew before. The
child becomes the adult, and the adult passes into senility,
while the self remains the same,&mdash;growing and developing
and shrinking, to be sure, but essentially unchanged
throughout. <i>That is the natural view</i>; and for the most
part it goes unchallenged.</p>

<p><i>Let us see, however, whether it may not be questioned.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
We remember; that is true; but we also forget. The
fact that certain past events are remembered tells more
heavily, in common-sense thinking, than the fact that
very many past events are forgotten, simply because
it is human nature, as Bacon said, to give more weight
to positive than to negative instances; but science does
not emphasize; science takes all the facts at the same
level. The organism, again, is physically continuous,
and ‘the child is father of the man’; but who makes
these observations? Not I, who am the continuous
organism, but&mdash;in the first instance, at any rate&mdash;my
fellow-men, those who are about me; and my fellow-men
clinch their observations by the bestowal upon
me of a personal name. In primitive thought, the
superstitions that connect the name with the personality
are legion; and even to-day our own name is warmly
intimate, a very factor of our self. This name, which
forms part of us and holds us together all through life,
comes nevertheless from the outside; we do not name
ourselves! Consider, further, the influence of language
in general. It is clear that language, as it developed
forms of speech in accordance with the common-sense
notion of self, would powerfully reinforce that notion;
the words and phrases which at first expressed ideas
would come, in time, to shape or suggest ideas. The
common-sense view is thus accepted as natural; but
there is no proof that it is correct.</p>

<p>Suppose, then, that we openly challenge that view;
<i>what can we urge against it?</i> We find, first of all, that
<i>language</i> bears witness against itself. We say that a
man is at times ‘out of himself,’ ‘not himself,’ ‘beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
himself’; we say that he forgets, surpasses, loses, disregards,
neglects, discredits, contradicts himself; we
say that he does himself injustice, that he cannot contain
himself, and so forth. Our <i>daily life</i> bears witness
to the same effect. A man may be suave and affable
in business and a veritable bear at home; and the man
who sits as judge upon the bench, and plays a beginner’s
game upon the golf-course, and carries his little son pick-a-back
to bed, is he the same self in all three situations?
There are changes of selfhood so abrupt that they remind
us of the ‘mutations’ of the biologists: religious conversion,
loss of fortune, sudden elevation to a position
of responsibility, disappointment in love, may make
‘another man’ of the man we knew. The seven ages,
we might almost say, correspond with as many different
selves; it is a common remark that so-and-so has not
fulfilled the promise of his youth, and that so-and-so
is no longer the man he was. <i>Pathology</i> brings corroboration
of the most striking kind; there are cases of
<b>dual or multiple personality</b>, in which the same ‘individual’
shows at different times very marked differences
of intelligence, emotivity and conduct, differences so
marked that the same organism appears as two or more
distinct ‘selves’; and these selves may be wholly separate
in experience, so that one self has no knowledge or
memory of the experiences of another. Here, therefore,
the abnormal is a more trenchant and clean-cut
figure of the normal; it is the normal carried, so to say,
to its logical extreme. The judge delivering a charge
does not think of his golf, and the irritated golf-player
does not think of his charge; but in the abnormal cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
the division may be complete; the one ‘personality’
<i>cannot</i> think of the other.</p>

<p><i>If, then, there are facts which look toward the persistence
and continuity and stability of the self, there are also other
facts which look toward impermanence and discontinuity
and instability.</i> Common sense has laid stress upon
the positive evidence, and has enshrined in language
the concept of a persistent and continuous self. This
one-sided attitude, as we are now to see, has had its
effect upon psychology. We have carried the present
analysis only so far as was necessary for our own purposes;
the full psychological discussion of the self of
common sense belongs, as we said just now, to another
branch of the science.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c315" id="c315">§ 75</a>. <b>The Self in Experience.</b>&mdash;So far, we have been
discussing the psychological self as viewed, so to say,
from the outside; we have found out what the word
‘self’ means when it is used as a technical term like
‘mind’ or ‘memory.’ We have now to raise a different
question, and to ask: <i>How is</i> <b>myself</b> <i>represented in
experience?</i> There are very many occasions when the
organism is, literally, thrown back on <i>itself</i>, when it
meets a situation by a <i>self</i>-response; what mental
processes are then involved?</p>

<p>Self, in such cases, is a meaning; and, in principle,
<i>any mental process whatsoever may represent the self</i> (or
the phase or feature of the self that is called forth by
the situation) <i>if its context and determination carry the
meaning of selfhood</i>. We can hardly expect, however,
that the context and determination will be explicit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
a group of mental processes lying open to observation.
For the meaning of self is very old in human history;
and we learn from early childhood to speak a language
in which it is already stereotyped, a language which
bristles with <i>I</i> and <i>my</i>. We shall say more about language
later. Meantime, you see that these are just the
circumstances in which context and determination cease
to be explicit, and reduce to a set or disposition of the
nervous system (p. 120). Hence we must be satisfied
to distinguish the <i>forms</i> in which the self-experience appears,
and to discover what <i>particular mental processes</i>,
if any, fall characteristically into these self-forms. In
other words, we enquire whether the self-meaning attaches
to a perception, or an idea, or a feeling, and so
on down the list; and we enquire also whether the self-perception
or self-idea, or whatever the form may be,
is characteristically visual or auditory or kinæsthetic,
and so on. In principle, remember, any form and any
kind of process may represent the self, provided that the
self-context and the self-determination are somehow
there; we are now to gather observations, and to see
what forms and what processes do, in fact, represent the
self in our experience.</p>

<p>Let us begin, however, by clearing out of the way certain
<b>erroneous views</b> that have appeared in psychology
under the influence of common sense. Since the self
of common sense is persistent, it has been argued that
the self-experience must also be continuous; and psychologists,
instead of going to the facts, have tried to find
a basis in experience for this supposed continuity. <i>It is
sometimes said, for instance, that all mental processes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
alike are essentially self-processes</i>; <i>because</i> they are processes
within a particular psychological world, <i>because</i>
they belong to a self, <i>therefore</i> they have the character
of selfness stamped upon them, and are known and
experienced as processes-of-me. Does that view seem
to you to be natural and reasonable? But consider
the logic of it; try a parallel argument! We might as
well say that <i>because</i> every native-born American belongs
to the group of American citizenship, <i>therefore</i>
he is always aware that he is an American citizen; or
that <i>because</i> a certain man is wealthy, <i>therefore</i> he is
always aware of his possessions. The fallacy is plain.
<i>It is sometimes said, again, that not all mental processes
alike, but only the feeling-processes</i>&mdash;sense-feelings, emotions,
sentiments, feeling-attitudes&mdash;<i>have this character
of selfness stamped upon them</i>; the feelings are ‘subjective’
experiences, and therefore being with them a
reference to the self. The confusion is the same as
that which we have just pointed out; it is argued that,
because all the feeling-processes <i>are</i> subjective (we
need not enquire too curiously what that word means!),
therefore they must always <i>mean</i> the great subjective
thing, the self; because a man <i>is</i> wealthy, therefore
his wealth must always <i>mean</i> wealth to him; whereas
it may, in various circumstances, mean an oil-painting
or a steam-yacht. There is, however, another objection.
This view maintains that feeling-processes of
some kind are always present in experience; otherwise,
indeed, they could not continuously refer to self; but
observation shows that much of our experience is indifferent,
without tinge of feeling. <i>It is sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
said, once more, that the organic sensations are the peculiar
self-experiences</i>; they are always with us, forming a
constant background of self, upon which our other and
less stable experiences come and go. But it may be
doubted whether these sensations are continuous; at
any rate, they vary enormously in intensity and in their
appeal to the attention. An experience of nausea is
overwhelming; but need there be, in perfect health,
any sensation whatever from heart-beat or breathing
or digestion? Moreover, the logic of the position is
still unsound. For a continuous experience is not necessarily
the experience of something continuous; the
fact that a man is all the while wealthy does not imply
that he is continually realising his wealth.</p>

<p>Having thus cleared the ground of bad argument,
we may turn to the facts of observation. The question
whether the self-experience is or is not continuous we
leave, for the moment, entirely open. We ask, first:
<i>In what form or forms does this self-experience occur?</i>
and the answer is: In all possible forms. We may
<i>perceive</i> ourself, as when we consult the glass to make
sure that we look all right; we may have an <i>idea</i> of
ourself, in memory or imagination; we may have a
<i>feeling</i> of self, when we are lonely or vexed or ill at ease;
we may have a <i>concept</i> of self, as when we say emphatically
in conversation ‘<i>I</i> can’t conceive of so-and-so’;
we may have all sorts of <i>self-attitudes</i>, intellectual and
emotive. Any form of mental connection may appear
under a determination, or in a context, that gives it the
meaning of self; only be clear that it is always the determination
or context, and not the form, which is recept;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
ponsible for the selfness of the experience. We look
in the glass, time and again, without having a self-perception;
and we are often lonely and uncomfortable,
without having a self-feeling; and we may say ‘I’
a hundred times over, without having a self-concept.
The setting is what gives the self-meaning to the experience.</p>

<p>We ask, secondly: <i>Are there any particular mental
processes that enter characteristically into the self-forms?</i>
and here the answer is less easy. We have seen that
language has a large number of self-words ready made
for us to use; and we learn in our early years&mdash;sometimes
painfully enough&mdash;to connect the self with our
body. So the perceived self tends to be a visual perception
of the body, or of some part of it; the felt self
tends to be a blend of feeling with kinæsthetic and organic
sensation (these processes are, indeed, regular
components of feelings and mental attitudes); while
the conceived self is, of course, a matter of verbal perception
and idea,&mdash;ordinarily, that is, a matter of
auditory-kinæsthetic complexes. If, however, these
processes are characteristic, we have no evidence that
they are essential; continued observation would probably
show that the self-meaning may attach to all sorts
of processes, as it is carried by all sorts of forms, so
that tones and touches, tastes and smells, may on occasion
come to us as the experienced Me.</p>

<p>On the whole, therefore, what holds in principle of
the <i>form of the self-experience</i> holds also in observable
fact; the experience may take all possible forms; though,
in a given mind, some forms may appear more frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
than others. Within the different forms, on the other
hand, there seems to be a tendency toward the appearance
of <i>particular mental processes</i>, those concerned in
the visual perception of the body, in felt organic stir
and in verbal perceptions and ideas. And now, <i>what of
continuity</i>?</p>

<p>Prejudice is strong; but you must be ready to discard
it. <i>Experimental and everyday observation both testify, when
the question is directly put, to the intermittence of the self-experience.</i>
We are not always aware of our self. The
self-experience does not appear, for example, when we
are engaged in our ordinary routine employment. It
does not appear in concentrated thought; the views
and theories which a popular psychology regards as
personal are, as a rule, quite selfless in their forming and
phrasing. It does not appear when we are absorbed in
a novel, or a play, or the hearing of music. It need not
appear in many of the situations that are designated by
self-words. The very fact that we can call it up at will,
that we can ‘come to ourselves’ whenever we like, indicates
that it is not always present in our experience.
<i>It is the specific expression of a special determination</i>;
and the frequency of the determination varies, we must
suppose, in different cases; some of us are continually
recurring to a self-experience, while others find it a
more casual visitor.</p>

<p>You should not accept this conclusion blindly; you
may test it in your own experience. Notice meanwhile
that, if it is sound, it throws further light upon the
theories of pp. 316 ff. Mental processes are not always
experienced as self-processes, but all mental forms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
probably all mental processes may lie under the self-determination.
Feelings do not always bring a reference
to self, but the self-meaning is very often carried by a
feeling. The organic sensations are not always self-experiences,
but a self-feeling may be largely composed of
organic processes. If we have dismissed the theories
themselves, we must still credit them with the measure
of truth that they contain.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c321" id="c321">§ 76</a>. <b>The Snares of Language.</b>&mdash;You were warned
on p. 36 that language may be misleading, and that the
phrases which you naturally use oftentimes imply a view
of the world, or an attitude towards experience, which is
foreign to science. Nowhere, perhaps, is this discrepancy
greater than in the phrases which refer to the self.
Language, as we know, is older than science, and expresses
the results of common-sense interpretation rather
than of factual observation. <i>The self of language is,
accordingly; not the psychological self, but the counterpart
of the mannikin-mind</i> (p. 7); and just as we must be on
guard, and remember our psychological definition, whenever
in a psychological context we say or think the word
‘mind,’ so must we be on guard against the common-sense
notion of ‘self’ that has insinuated itself into a
thousand turns of familiar speech. An observer, describing
a particular experience, may say, quite naturally,
‘I find no trace of self-reference!’&mdash;and there is no
harm done, if we realise that the <i>I</i> of his remark is the
traditional self-concept of language, and the <i>self</i> the
psychological experience of self; but there may be very
great harm, if likeness of words leads us to confound the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
personal with the impersonal, common sense with science.
Only by an unreadable pedantry can we avoid the I-phrases
and the other personal sentences; but we must
always bear in mind that <i>language, the very form and structure
of it, embodies a theory, an explanation or interpretation
of the self</i>; and that, if we reject this theory, we have
to couch our criticism in terms of the theory we reject.</p>

<p>There is another danger. Language has many words
which begin with <i>self</i>: self-possession, self-assurance,
self-consciousness, and the like; and the implication
is that the corresponding mental processes represent
self-experiences, in the sense of p. 315. But do they?
Let us take <i>self-consciousness</i> as an example. A young
lecturer stands for the first time upon the platform, and a
kindly soul in the audience may murmur: ‘Poor young
man! he is dreadfully self-conscious!’ Truly, the signs
are there: parched throat, burning cheeks, gasping
breath, hoarse and broken voice, moist and trembling
hands, uncertainty of all coordinated movements;
everything that indicates what the audience, from their
external standpoint (p. 313), must regard as self-consciousness;
and yet there may be nothing whatever of self-reference
in the lecturer’s own experience. He feels
timid, excited, heartily uncomfortable; but it is very
unlikely that he is thinking of himself; he has too many
other things to think of! Suppose that his lecture is a
success, and that he steps from the lecture-room in a
mood of self-congratulation; he feels relief, relaxation;
he ‘glows’ with satisfaction and pride; but, again,
there need be no sort of self-reference in his experience.
Yet, in writing to a friend about the eventful lecture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
he may very well say: ‘I felt terribly self-conscious when
I began, but afterwards I really was a bit pleased with
myself!’ The personal forms are so natural as to be
almost inevitable. How often, when a conversation has
languished, do two or three persons with a simultaneous
impulse try to revive it&mdash;by uttering a long-drawn ‘I’!
and how often are we surprised, when we read over a
letter just written, to see that every paragraph begins
with the same ‘I’! Not by any means necessarily
because we are thinking at the time of ourselves, but very
likely because we have nothing urgent to say, and so
slip instinctively into the commonest and most stereotyped
pattern of speech. Language, therefore, is no more
than any other movement (p. 232) an index to mind. The
I-phrases and the self-words may carry a self-meaning,
or they may not; it all depends upon the determination
of the moment.</p>

<p><i>Do not imagine, however, that psychology alone suffers
from this warp and bias of language</i>! The tendency to
personalisation (p. 205), which shows itself in the mannikin-mind
and the common-sense self, appears also in
the ‘forces’ of physics and the ‘attractions’ of chemistry;
and if the psychologist has to clarify the current
notions of mind and self, the worker in these other
sciences must, on his side, come to terms with a like heritage
of equivocal words. All such concepts illustrate
the same speculative trend of primitive thinking; and all
of them are stumbling-blocks in the path of science.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c323" id="c323">§ 77</a>. <b>Consciousness and The Subconscious.</b>&mdash;“Consciousness,”
says Professor Ward, “is the vaguest, most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
protean, and most treacherous of psychological terms”;
and Bain, writing in 1880, distinguished no less than
thirteen meanings of the word; he could find more to-day!
The <b>ambiguity</b> of the term seems to be due, in
the last resort, to <i>the running together of two fundamental
meanings</i>, the one of which is scientific or psychological,
the other logical or philosophical. <i>In the latter, the
logical meaning, consciousness is awareness or knowledge</i>,
and ‘conscious of’ means ‘aware of’; <i>in the former, the
scientific meaning, consciousness is mental experience</i>,
experience regarded from the psychological point of view,
and one can no more use the phrase ‘conscious of’ than
one can use ‘mental of.’ If you think how natural it is
to say ‘I was conscious of so-and-so,’ you will realise
that the logical meaning is generally current; and if
you remember that we have the terms ‘mind,’ ‘mental
process,’ as names of mental experience, you will see
that in psychology the word ‘consciousness’ is unnecessary;
we have, in fact, not used it in this book,&mdash;until
we came upon the popular expression ‘self-consciousness’
in § 76.</p>

<p>We have avoided the word, however, not only because
it is unnecessary, but also because the logical or philosophical
meaning that it tends to suggest is directly harmful
in psychology. For <i>the psychologist has nothing in
the world to do with knowledge or awareness</i>; he stands,
in this regard, upon precisely the same level as the physicist
or the chemist. Look up the word <i>atom</i> in a dictionary;
you find, perhaps, that it is ‘an ultimate indivisible
particle of matter’; and you would smile if you read
‘knowledge of an ultimate indivisible particle of matter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>’
Look up <i>metal</i>; and you find ‘an elementary substance
possessing such and such properties’; you would think
it absurd to say ‘an awareness of an elementary substance’
possessing those properties. But now think of
<i>sensation</i>, which is an elementary mental process (p. 65):
you would probably not smile if you found ‘the first
stage of knowledge; the elementary way of knowing
some phenomenon of the outside world’; and that is
because you are thoroughly accustomed to regard consciousness
as awareness, and conscious processes as
processes which are aware of something beyond themselves.
Yet it is every whit as absurd, from the scientific
point of view, to make sensation a ‘stage of knowledge’
or a ‘way of knowing’ as it is to define the atom as
‘knowledge’ or the metal as ‘an awareness.’ Science
takes experience for granted, deals with the nature of
things given (p. 4); so that questions about ‘knowing’
or ‘being aware of’ lie beyond the range of science,
whether the particular science is psychology or physics.</p>

<p>You now understand why it is that we have avoided
the term ‘consciousness.’ If we had said that <i>red</i> is an
elementary conscious process, then you might have
supposed that it is an elementary process in or by which
you become aware of a red object; whereas, if we say
that <i>red</i> is an elementary mental process, you have no
reason to think of the red object, since ‘to become mental
of a red object’ is not English. It is very likely, all the
same, that you <i>have</i> been thinking of the object of
knowledge, in spite of the terminology of the book, and
in spite of the express warning that science has nothing
to do with values or meanings or uses; the statements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
a text-book, however emphatic they are, cannot always
make headway against ingrained habits of thought and
speech. If, then, you have at any point fallen into this
mistake (and it may comfort you to know that the author,
in his first years of studentship, was trapped by it again
and again), go back now and read over the chapters in
point; and if you discover that the mistake was partly
due to the language there employed, remember that
authors are human and that words are very slippery
things.</p>

<p>So much of consciousness: what, now, shall we say of
the <b>subconscious</b>? The term is fashionable; and though
we have nowhere used it, we can hardly pass it by without
mention. The subconscious may be defined as <i>an
extension of the conscious beyond the limits of observation</i>.
As an extension of the <i>conscious</i>, it tends always
to be an extension of meaning beyond the <i>meaning</i> of
the conscious; we do not hear of a ‘submental.’ As an
<i>extension</i> of the conscious, it is always a matter of
<i>inference</i>; what we cannot observe, we must infer. So
there needs no argument to prove that the subconscious is
not a part of the subject-matter of psychology. How,
then, does it come into psychology?</p>

<p>It comes in as <i>an explanatory concept</i>, like the older
concept of association (p. 146), to account for, to rationalise,
the phenomena that are conscious. We have
ourselves been satisfied with description and correlation,
and we have therefore confined ourselves to mental and
nervous processes which are in principle observable;
though we have often enough been obliged to say that
the facts, in this or that chapter of psychology or neurology,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
are few or wanting. There is, however, in many
minds, a craving for ‘explanation’; and it must be
admitted that such a craving is natural enough; for it
shows in every phase of primitive thought, and may be
traced throughout the history of science. Think, for
instance, of the potency of explanation by ‘cause and
effect’!&mdash;though when we examine a case of cause and
effect we never, in fact, find anything more than correlation.
There are many psychologists, then, who cannot
be satisfied with description and correlation; they
must refer the direction of thought to a ‘subconscious disposition,’
and explain the connections of ideas by ‘subconscious
tendencies,’ and so on. They have recourse
to the subconscious for purposes of explanation.</p>

<p>We must urge two objections against this mode of
psychologising. In the first place, <i>the construction of a
subconscious is unnecessary</i>. Science is not called upon
to ‘explain’ anything; description and correlation are
the modern&mdash;and more modest&mdash;representatives of
the ‘explanation’ that an older science looked for and
professed to find. Secondly, <i>the introduction of a subconscious
is dangerous</i>. It is a matter of inference
from the conscious; but who shall draw the line, in such
a case, between legitimate and illegitimate inference?
When from the course of the mental stream and the interplay
of mental processes we infer the existence of associative
and determining tendencies in the nervous
system, our argument is safeguarded. No man, it is
true, has seen those tendencies in course; but the inference
to them is checked and controlled by the whole
vast body of fact and method that makes up modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
physiology. Things stand very differently with the subconscious.
Here the inference must, it is plain, go beyond
the conscious, since its aim is to explain the conscious;
yet the conscious facts are all the facts we have;
when once we have embarked on the subconscious, there
are no more facts to steer by. Henceforth everything
depends upon individual preference; and we may have
many theories of the subconscious, widely different and
equally plausible. The danger is that an erroneous
theory of the subconscious distort our view of the conscious.</p>

<p>There is, however, another side to this whole question.
<i>The notion of a subconscious has proved useful in certain
fields of practical psychology, and more especially in psychiatry
and psychotherapeutics; and in matters of practice
utility is a sufficient justification.</i> Science cannot ask
the physician to give up a theory which works. She
can only point out that present utility is no test of ultimate
truth,&mdash;there were plenty of useful inventions in
the days when the physics of heat was dominated by
the theory of caloric, and the physics of light by the
theory of emission!&mdash;and that nobody has ever observed,
or can ever observe, the subconscious at work;
the wonderful things that it does testify rather to their
reporter’s thought and imagination, to his conscious ingenuity
in explaining, than to the scientific reality of
the subconscious itself.</p>


<p class="p2"><a name="c328" id="c328">§ 78</a>. <b>Conclusion.</b>&mdash;So we are at an end; and as you
look back over the chapters of the book, you will have
your own thoughts about the work done,&mdash;about your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
change of attitude from common sense to psychology,
about the nature of mind, when mind is regarded from
the scientific point of view, about the difficult or unsatisfactory
places in psychology. The author has no wish
to disturb these thoughts; every student must sum
things up for himself, as every student, if he is to get the
scientific point of view, must rely on his own thinking
from the beginning (p. 36); for the kingdom of science
is not in word but in power. There are, nevertheless,
a few considerations that may be set down here, not as a
summary made for you by the author, but simply as
a general supplement to your own conclusions.</p>

<p>Realise, then, first of all, that <i>there is nothing in the
whole wide world that cannot be psychologised</i>. Sound
and light and heat, law and language and morals, “the
whole choir of heaven and furniture of earth,” all alike
become subject-matter of psychology if we regard them
from the psychological standpoint, as they are in man’s
experience (p. 9). The range of psychology is the range
of that experience, and nothing more narrow. The
psychological point of view is logically coordinate with
the point of view of the physical sciences; these describe
the world with man left out, psychology describes the
world with man left in; but the psychologist surveys the
broader field.</p>

<p>Realise, secondly, that <i>you have the materials and the
opportunity of psychological observation always with you</i>.
Truly, we must have laboratories; if we are to attain to
accurate and comparable results, we must put ourselves
under conditions that can be rigorously controlled. But
get the habit of psychological observation, and you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
be surprised to find (though it follows, does it not,
from the laws of attention?) how much psychology
there is in your daily life; how often you can snapshot
a baffling experience, and catch a hint of analytical
possibilities; how often you light upon something that
the text-books do not discuss, but that this habit of
observation reveals and places for you. Take the
occasions as they come; plenty of good astronomical
work has been done with a pair of opera glasses!&mdash;and
if you cannot, later on, experiment for yourself in a
laboratory, at least you have gained a new outlook and
a new competence; it is as if you had gained access
to a whole literature by the mastery of some foreign
language.</p>

<p>Realise, thirdly, that <i>a system of science, whether the
science be psychology or any other, is built up of nothing
else than facts and logic</i>. The facts of observation are
the essential things; without them there is no science
possible; but logic makes the facts available and rememberable;
it groups and classifies, decides the sequence
of chapters and paragraphs, points to gaps and
discrepancies in the record of facts, governs the whole
presentation. So there should be nothing more in a
text-book of science than facts and logic. The man of
science, trying to answer an unanswered question (p. 277),
will guess and forecast and speculate and imagine; and
some of his guesses and speculations may be worthy of
mention in the history of his science; but there should be
no glimmer of them in the scientific system. Science,
you remember, is impersonal and disinterested, dry fact
and cold logic; there are all sorts of personal adventures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
and interesting episodes by the way, while science is
in the making; but if you have the scientific temperament,
you feel the fascination of fact and logic themselves.</p>

<p>And, in any case, they are all that science gives you!
So realise, lastly, <i>the limitations of science; do not expect
from it more than it can give</i>. Over and over you hear
it said ‘Science has failed to satisfy us about this’ and
‘Science has shown itself unable to deal with that’;
but ask yourself&mdash;if you deem the statements true&mdash;what
are the ‘this’ and the ‘that,’ and whether science
ever gave any pledge that she would handle them.
Scientific discoveries have had far-reaching consequences
for practice, and have changed our whole mode of
living; but the fact remains that “the most useful
parts of science have been investigated for the sake of
truth, and not for their usefulness.” Scientific progress
is reflected in the systems of logic and ethics and æsthetics,
even in metaphysics itself; but theoretical values
lie, as practical values also lie, beyond the purview of the
scientific enquirer. Science is bound down from the
outset to a certain method, the method of observation;
to a certain point of view, the existential as opposed to
the significant; to a certain task, the task of description
and correlation. Beyond these limits, science has no
pretensions; within them, she has accomplished much,
and is earnest to accomplish more.</p>

<p class="pc2"><a name="c332" id="c332"><b>Questions and Exercises</b></a></p>

<p class="p1">(1) Keep a pad by you for a week, and note down the
occasions when your experience is wholly selfless and
markedly selfful. Describe, as well as you can, the various
self-experiences.</p>


<p>(2) Mention some of the superstitions that connect the name
with the personality (p. 313). Is there any echo of these
superstitions in our own civilised experience?</p>


<p>(3) On p. 319 a hint is given of the way in which vision,
kinæsthesis and organic sensation, and verbal ideas might
come to be preferred, as vehicles of the meaning of self. Can
you make any further suggestion as regards kinæsthesis
and organic sensation?</p>


<p>(4) A well-known medical writer remarks: “Self is
stomach. The function of assimilating food is the most
fundamental of all the functions; it is antecedent even to
locomotion and propagation. Hence anything which directly
affects the organism as a whole affects the stomach.” What
self is here referred to?</p>


<p>(5) Professor Mach tells the following story. “I got into
an omnibus one morning, after a tiring night on the train,
just as some one else was entering from the far end. ‘Some
broken-down schoolmaster,’ I thought. It was myself;
there was a large mirror opposite the omnibus door” (see
Analysis of Sensations, 1910, 4). What psychological laws
does the story illustrate?</p>


<p>(6) What is meant by the ‘unity of consciousness’?</p>


<p>(7) Sir Walter Scott tells the tale of a boy, always at the
top of his class, who, when asked a question, “fumbled with
his fingers at a particular button in the lower part of his waistcoat”;
Scott cut the button off, and the boy came down
from his place of leadership (J. G. Lockhart, Memoirs of the
Life of Sir Walter Scott, i., 1837, 94). What is the psychology
of the incident?</p>


<p>(8) Write a psychological criticism of the following statement:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
“Alike in conflict, rivalry, sense of liability to punishment
or vengeance, etc., the truth is continually being borne
in upon the mind of an animal that it is a separate individuality;
and this though it be conceded that the animal is
never able, even in the most shadowy manner, to think about
itself as such. In this way there arises a sort of ‘outward
self-consciousness,’ which differs from true or inward self-consciousness
only in the absence of any attention being
directed upon the inward mental states as such” (G. J.
Romanes, Mental Evolution in Man, 1888, 198 f.).</p>


<p>(9) Among the facts which have led to the hypothesis
of a subconscious are (<i>a</i>) the existence of blind strivings,
organic tendencies, etc., for which no conscious antecedent
can be discovered; (<i>b</i>) the mechanisation of complicated
movements, such as piano-playing; (<i>c</i>) the appearance in
‘memory’ of ideas which seem to have cropped up of themselves,
<i>i.e.</i>, have no assignable physical or mental condition;
(<i>d</i>) the phenomena of secondary personality (Dictionary of
Philosophy and Psychology, ii., 1902, 606). How does the
hypothesis help in such cases? and how does the psychology
of this book take account of the facts?</p>


<p>(10) Consider any case of remedial suggestion, of what is
popularly called faith-cure, that you happen to know at
first-hand. Show how the hypothesis of subconscious
agency might naturally occur to one who tries to ‘explain’
the facts, and show how science might deal with them apart
from that hypothesis.</p>


<p>(11) (<i>a</i>) Satisfy yourself, by the collection of phrases,
that the words ‘conscious,’ ‘subconscious,’ ‘unconscious,’
are used in very various meanings. (<i>b</i>) What does the word
‘conscious’ mean by derivation? How did it originate?</p>


<p>(12) The complaint is often made that scientific men do
not popularise their results. What do you take to be the
great stumbling-block in the way of popularisation?</p>

<p class="psh">I am assured that a lady of a well-known court saw in a dream and
described to her friends the person she afterwards married, and the hall
in which the betrothal was celebrated; and she did this before she had
seen or known either the man or the place. They attributed the circumstance
to some indefinite secret presentiment; but chance may produce
this effect, since it is quite rare that it happens; besides, dream-images
being somewhat obscure, there is more liberty in connecting them
afterwards with certain others.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</span></p>


<p>§ 79. <b>Sleep and Dream.</b>&mdash;The profound sleep that comes
to us every night, and that we take entirely as a matter of
course, rests without any doubt upon an instinctive tendency;
but there can be little doubt, either, that the instinct has
been modified in the course of human evolution. <i>It seems
probable, indeed, that profound sleep, the lapse of all but the
vegetative organic functions, has been developed from the same
fundamental tendency as hypnosis</i>, so that natural sleep
and artificial hypnosis represent two branches which
spring from a single stem. This original and instinctive
tendency is toward what we may call, in biological phrase,
a <b>partial or defensive sleep</b>, a rest enjoyed while the animal
is still partly on guard. It underlies the sleep of the mother,
who is roused at once by the movement of her infant child;
the sleep of the nurse, who is awaked by the restlessness of
her patient; the sleep of the tired horseman or driver, who
keeps the saddle or holds the reins, and remains alive to any
sign of uneasiness on the part of his horse. It shows also in
the ability of the wearied surgeon to rouse himself and perform
an operation, though he falls asleep once more the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
moment it is over and has no remembrance of it at his normal
waking. Such a partial rest, persisting only thus occasionally
in the life of civilised man, is all that an animal surrounded
by dangers can afford; if sight and smell and taste
may be allowed to lapse, still touch and hearing must keep
awake,&mdash;must keep awake, at any rate, to the kind of
stimulus that spells danger. We are speaking now in figurative
terms; the history and nervous mechanism of the sleep-tendency
offer a problem to science, and must be scientifically
worked out; but it is enough here if you get a general notion
of the way in which sleep began.</p>

<p>In process of time, as dangers grow less or as the nightly care
of the community is put into the hands of watchmen whose
special duty it is to signal their approach, <i>sleep becomes total
and profound</i>. Even our own protected sleep, however, is
not always undisturbed. We resign ourselves to it with a
full sense of security; and we go to sleep in a dark and quiet
room, we rid ourselves of the friction of clothes, we keep a
constant temperature in our bedroom, we lie down. Sleep,
nevertheless, is interrupted, more or less often according to
age and constitution, by a <b>dream</b>, by a series of experiences
like those of the waking life; and sometimes the dream is
accompanied by muscular activity; we talk or walk in our
sleep.</p>

<p>The dream, then, is subject-matter for psychology; and
the first question that we have to ask about it concerns its
make-up; <i>of what mental processes is the dream composed</i>?
The answer is twofold. So far as <i>pattern</i> goes, anything whatsoever
may appear in the dream-state: perception, memory,
emotion, imagination, thought, everything. But as regards
the <i>mental processes</i> themselves, the dream is selective;
certain processes are preferred for dreaming, so to say, as
certain processes are preferred for the representation of
self. The details of dreams are very quickly forgotten;
and there is always danger lest recall and report, in the waking
state, change the terms of a dream, translate them from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
their original mode into the customary terms of waking experience.
We have, however, a large number of records,
taken under favourable conditions, and we find substantial
agreement among the various observers. Dreams are mainly
visual, though lights are more and colours are less common,
perhaps, than is ordinarily supposed. Next in order of
frequency to vision stands audition; conversation, especially,
is a common feature of dreams. Next follow sense-feelings
and feeling-attitudes; unpleasant experiences seem, on the
whole, to be more frequent than pleasant, though there are
marked individual differences. Thereafter, at a wide remove,
come touch and kinæsthesis and organic complexes;
and last of all, taste and smell.</p>

<p>We know so little of the nervous correlates of the dream
that a discussion of these facts must of necessity be speculative.
It has been said that we dream largely in terms of
sight for the same reason that we remember and imagine
largely in those terms (‘dream’ is, for that matter, the older
English word for ‘imagine’): the eye is the most important
of all the sense-organs, the organ most continuously used,
and the organ most relied upon for knowledge of the outside
world; hence the visual centre of the brain has multitudinous
connections with all the other brain-centres, and is readily
excited when any one of them is excited. It has been pointed
out, also, that the eye is extremely sensitive to slight changes
of illumination, as well as to changes in the pressure of the
eyelids, the state of circulation in the retina, and so forth;
and that the sensations thus set up are reinforced by the persistent
central grey. Observation has proved that the figures
of a dream-scene may roughly correspond with the dots and
splashes of light and colour that you see over the dark field
of vision just before you fall asleep. So in regard to hearing:
it may be said that verbal perceptions and ideas are, in the
waking life, subordinate in number and importance only to
those of vision; and it may be said, also, that the ear is the
great defensive organ of the night-time, so that ear-sleep (if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
we may coin the word) is rarely profound, and the ear is
liable to excitation by any chance crack or rustle in our surroundings,
even by the pulsing of the blood through its own
vessels. Here, indeed, we raise the whole difficult question
of <i>the origination of dreams</i>. We cannot say that a dream
may not arise ‘in the brain’ altogether apart from stimulation
of a sense-organ; yet the sense-organs are always
liable to stimulation, from without or from within; we know
that stimuli, too weak to arouse a sleeper, will set up dreams;
and it seems safe to conclude that most dreams are originated
by sensory stimulation, while their subsequent course is due
to associative and perhaps to determining tendencies active
at the moment. Attempts have been made to refer certain
familiar kinds of dream&mdash;dreams of flying, falling, appearing
in public scantily clothed, preparing for a journey, etc.&mdash;to
particular forms of stimulus: arrest of heart-beat, irregular
breathing, cold from the slipping down of bed-clothes, etc.;
but no positive correlation has been arrived at.</p>

<p><i>Dreams are ordinarily regarded as the type of fantastic and
disordered experience</i>, “the children of an idle brain, begot
of nothing but vain fantasy”; and some dreams, it is true,
are very fragmentary, and some dream-combinations seem
ridiculous enough to the waking judgement, and some shifts
of dream-scene are startlingly abrupt. It may be questioned,
nevertheless, whether the changes are in fact more sudden
or more radical than those of the waking life, and whether
the grouping is more fantastic than in the day-dream. <i>The
great perceptive attitudes remain for the most part unchanged.</i>
We notice, on later reflection, that time may be curiously
foreshortened, so that we have the events of a day crowded
into a few seconds; but this is due partly to the occurrence
of attitudes, of the nutshell-packing of experiences (p. 271),
such as we find also in our waking memories, and partly to
our own reflective reading of the dream; we, who are now
awake, distribute the events over a day, much as the novelist
may do in telling his story, or the playwright in developing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
his plot. <i>The sense of personal identity is rarely lost</i>; and
the dream frequently reflects the personality of the dreamer;
temperament, interests, principles, show themselves in it;
no one of us could dream his neighbour’s dreams. In general,
too, <i>the dream plays about a topic or situation</i>; and if the
changes are both sudden and profound, we must remember
that our waking trains are held in course, as dreams are not,
by the continuity of the stimuli around us, and that even so we
are often interrupted in a current train, and shift from topic
to topic at a moment’s notice. The dream is under no
external control by an environment, nor is it as a rule organised
and regulated throughout by a dominant determining
tendency, as is the case with thought and constructive
imagination. It is subject, however, to the laws of associative
tendency, and sometimes at any rate it seems to issue
from a determination; a dream may, for example, be continued
on successive nights. On the whole, then, <i>dream-experience
is less disorderly than is usually supposed</i>. Our
statements must be guarded: we cannot say that the perceptive
attitudes are never disturbed; we know that personality
may be greatly modified; we know that scene may
follow scene in the most bizarre way. The whole trend of
popular psychology, however, is to emphasize the differences
between dreaming and waking, while the trend of accurate
observation is to bring them together.</p>

<p>The <i>dream-incidents</i> are derived, in the lighter stages of
of sleep, mainly from the incidents of the preceding day,
and in the deeper stages mainly from the remoter experience
of the waking life. This is what we should expect from our
knowledge of the temporal course of associative tendencies.
Moreover, we know that, in profound sleep, the brain is
comparatively bloodless; and it is reasonable to suppose that,
in dreaming, the activity of the tendencies is local and
sporadic. That would account for the <i>incongruities</i> that our
waking judgement discovers in the dream-situations, and
also for the general <i>ineffectiveness</i> of dream-thought. When,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
however, we enquire further into the nervous mechanism of
dreaming, we must enter the realm of hypothesis. <i>It is a
real puzzle</i>, for instance, <i>that we do not oftener walk and talk
in our sleep</i>; for dream-ideas are vivid, and the vivid ideas
of the waking life are ordinarily followed or accompanied by
action. We may guess that there is a positive blocking of
the nerve-paths that lead from sensory to motor centres in
the brain, or from the motor centres to the muscles; else the
dream would surely be talked or acted out; but we can say
nothing definite about this motor inhibition. The organism
at large seems to be under a ‘negative suggestion’ in regard
to movement; for the pattern of action&mdash;though, like all
the mental patterns, it may appear in the dream-state&mdash;is
notably less frequent than the patterns of perception and
idea and emotion.</p>

<p>We said that dream-ideas are vivid; and there is no doubt
that dreams in general have an <i>hallucinatory</i> character;
dream-images are extremely vivid, dream-scenes are staged
in what is taken for objective space, dream-events occur
without any felt dependence upon the dreamer. This impression
of the reality of dream-incident is partly due to a
negative condition; we have no means, in the dream-state, of
testing or checking what happens. In the waking life we
compare experience with experience; in the dream there is
nothing with which the present train of ideas may be compared.
It seems, however, that the hallucinatory character
is native to our dream-ideas, that it is due to positive as well
as negative conditions; though, again, we cannot say what
the conditions are, until we know more about the nervous
correlate of dreaming. The net result is that, in popular
phrase, <i>we take our dreams for granted</i>; the dream-world, so
long as we are in it, appears as real as the world of our waking
existence. This does not at all mean that we accept, blindly,
everything that takes place. We may protest and criticise
in dreams, just precisely as we protest and criticise in real
life; we may dream that we are dreaming, just as we sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
say ‘I must have been dreaming’ when we give a wrong
account of some waking experience or find ourselves mistaken
in a recollection; and we may have a sense of unreality in
dreams, just as we have it now and again in waking situations.
It means only that the nervous system of the dreamer is
stamped with the great biological tendencies that we have
noted and discussed; the tendency to take things as real is
present by night as well as by day.</p>

<p>The old common-sense notion that dreams are prophetic
has no foundation in fact. The idea that underlies it&mdash;the
idea that dreams must be of some use to the organism&mdash;nevertheless
persists, and has found recent expression in a
comprehensive theory of dreams. <i>The theory is that all
dreams, if one interprets them aright, represent the fulfilment of
a wish, entertained in the waking life but repressed by circumstances.</i>
The organism attains by night, though in
veiled and transmuted shape, what it has failed of attaining
by day. This theory has been elaborated and illustrated
with very great ingenuity; but <i>its claims are too sweeping</i>.
Recent observations seem to show that the wish-dream is
likely to occur in the hours before waking, rather than in
the early hours of the night or in the middle period of profound
sleep; that many dreams cannot be interpreted, even with
the best will, as fulfilments of wish; and, in particular, that
fear-dreams form a category as distinct and ultimate as
wish-dreams. The merit of the theory is that it emphasises
the feeling-processes of the dream-life; it does not give us
the key to the psychology of dreaming.</p>

<p class="p2"><a name="c341" id="c341">§ 80</a>. <b>Hypnosis.</b>&mdash;We have seen that there are two lines
of development from partial or defensive sleep; and that
hypnosis is the final term of the one line, as normal deep
sleep is the final term of the other. <i>Hypnosis may therefore
be regarded as a state in which the organism is partly asleep,
and partly alert and awake.</i> The wakefulness is characterised
by a high degree of attention; and the hypnotised subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
is accordingly liable to suggestion by anything that fits
in with the direction of attention.</p>

<p>The symptoms of hypnosis do not follow any stereotyped
pattern; so that <i>it is difficult to draw a generalised picture of
the hypnotic individual</i>. If, however, we are willing to run
the risk of generalisation, we may distinguish three successive
stages in the phenomena. The hypnotised subject is at
first <b>heavy or drowsy</b>; his behaviour is like that of a man
suddenly aroused from sound sleep, and not yet ‘come to
himself.’ Then follows the stage of light hypnosis or, as it is
technically called, the stage of <b>catalepsy</b>. The subject is to
some extent anæsthetic; his sense-organs are closed to all
the ordinary impressions from the outside world. At the
same time, he hears what is said to him by the operator, and
performs any action that the operator may suggest. He does
nothing without the word of command; so that he will
maintain a position, however uncomfortable it might be
under ordinary circumstances, until the order comes to relax
it. On waking, he remembers cloudily what took place
during hypnosis. In the third and final stage, which is
known as <b>somnambulism</b>, the anæsthesia becomes more
complete; and the subject not only acts, but also perceives,
at the bidding of the operator; takes coal for sugar, ink for
wine, tapping on the table for the playing of a violin, and so
forth. On waking, he has no memory of what has taken
place.</p>

<p>We see, then, that <i>there are four main symptoms of hypnosis:
anæsthesia, motionlessness, suggestibility and amnesia</i>; and
it is worth while to remind ourselves, at once, that all these
symptoms have their counterparts in the normal waking
life. Thus, a child falls down and hurts itself; it may be
crying bitterly; but you distract its attention by a toy, and
the crying stops and the pain is forgotten; the diversion of
attention has meant anæsthesia. Again, you are on a country
walk with a friend, and you begin to discuss some topic of
mutual interest; you both get more and more absorbed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
and you both walk more and more slowly, until presently you
find yourselves at a standstill in the middle of the road;
concentrated attention has meant arrest of movement. If
the lecturer in a class-room says: ‘I want you now to take
down what I am going to say,’ the suggestion is immediately
accepted, and the whole class makes ready to write. Finally,
we are all forgetful of what happens in a particular situation
if circumstances change and we are confronted by another
situation; how many of us remember our dreams? The
new day brings its novel situations, and the dreams drop
out of sight; and the change from dreaming to waking is
no greater than the change from the hypnotic to the normal
state. Hence the peculiarity of hypnosis is not the introduction
of strange or curious phenomena, but rather the
grouping, in an extreme and unusual way, of phenomena
with which we are in principle familiar.</p>

<p>It would seem to follow from this analysis that <i>we are all
and sundry liable, under certain favourable conditions, to fall
into the hypnotic state</i>; and that conclusion is borne out by
the facts. Only idiots and infants are exempt from hypnosis;
and they are exempt only because of the low development of
attention, because they cannot, under any conditions, concentrate
or ‘pull themselves together.’ When people tell
you that Professor So-and-so tried to hypnotise them, but
that their will proved too strong for him, you may reply that
they do not understand what they are talking about; it
would be as logical for them to assert that the champion
tennis-player of the world had failed to beat them in a match,
because they had refused to lift a racquet. The stronger
the ‘will,’ that is to say, the stronger the habit of absorbed
attention and the greater the power of dominant determinations,
the easier is the induction of hypnosis. Moreover,
as human beings are one and all liable to be hypnotised, so
do we find that the animals, in their degree, are liable to something
like catalepsy. The nightly sleep of birds and the
winter-sleep of many animals is a cataleptic sleep; very many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
insects ‘sham dead,’ as we say, when they are surprised or
handled; and animals may be thrown, by manipulation,
into an artificial state which resembles catalepsy in ourselves,
and which has received the like name of <b>cataplexy</b> (‘catalepsy’
is a seizure, and ‘cataplexy’ is a stroke).</p>

<p>So much for the primary facts: what, now, of the ‘operator’?
Well, it is quite possible to hypnotise oneself, just
as it is quite possible to put oneself to sleep by counting sheep
or listening to an imaginary rain. One has only to <i>mean</i> or
<i>intend</i> to oneself that the hypnotic state is coming, and&mdash;if
there is no interruption&mdash;it will presently come; self-suggestion
or autosuggestion may be as effective as the suggestion
of an operator. For <i>in every case the influence that the operator
has over the subject is an influence given him by the subject</i>;
the immediate conditions of hypnosis lie in the subject himself,
and not in the personality of some other man. The professional
operator has, it is true, two advantages. He asserts
emphatically that he ‘can hypnotise’; he advertises; and
we tend to believe emphatic and repeated statements, however
groundless they may really be; so that we are likely to
give him an influence over us before we have even seen him.
Secondly, the operator knows, from long experience with
hypnotised subjects, how the individual shall most readily be
brought into the hypnotic state, how (that is) his complete
attention may be secured and directed: whether by coaxing
or by bullying, whether by strokes of the hand that suggest
a gradual flow of power or by a smart blow on the back of the
neck that produces a momentary helplessness and confusion.
<i>All the ‘methods’ of hypnotising are so many tricks to bring
about a state of undivided attention and a corresponding
suggestibility in the subject.</i> So the operator has genuine
advantages, but they are advantages that might be secured
by anyone who took the trouble; they are not connected
with special gifts or superiorities.</p>

<p>Here, however, you may raise an objection; you will say
that operator and subject are <i>en rapport</i>, that there <i>is</i> a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
special bond which connects them, and that the records of
hypnosis prove it. Yes, there may be a special bond; and
yet the preceding paragraph sets forth the truth about the
operator. Do we not all believe in our own physician,
our own family lawyer, our own clergyman? and yet
our neighbours make different choices. Suppose, then,
that you have first-hand evidence of the powers of
some platform operator, or of some physician who treats
his patients hypnotically; you may very easily come to
think that this particular man has a peculiar control over you.
You may suggest this belief to yourself, or perhaps the
physician&mdash;not wishing to have his case interfered with by
others&mdash;may suggest it to you; in any event, you are imbued
with the idea that this man, and this man only, is able
to treat you; and it then follows, naturally, that the required
concentration of attention and the required openness to
suggestion can be secured only when he is present. But the
<i>rapport</i> is, after all, nothing more than <i>an insistent belief of
your own</i>; it is neither more effective nor less intelligible
than would be the contrary belief that a certain person of
your acquaintance could <i>not</i> hypnotise you. So far, therefore,
from invalidating our former conclusions, the occasional
existence of the <i>rapport</i> serves to confirm them.</p>

<p>We now turn from the hypnotic state itself to its relations
with the waking state; and the first point to consider is the
fact of <b>post-hypnotic or terminal suggestion</b>. Suppose
that an operator suggests to the hypnotised subject that a
certain action is to be performed at such-and-such a time after
waking; “before I wake you let me impress upon you that
you are to drink two glasses of water at five o’clock this
afternoon; you understand?&mdash;two glasses of water at five
o’clock.” The subject rouses; has no memory of the command;
and yet, when the time comes, obediently pours and
drinks the water. The fact is, you see, that the suggestion
of <i>time</i> builds a bridge between the two separate states, the
hypnotic and the waking; the idea of time is common to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
both. Hence when the suggested time comes round, and the
subject knows&mdash;by the clock, by the sun, by his occupation,
by his organic sensations&mdash;that five o’clock is approximately
here, this idea acts as a suggestion; the hypnotic state is
reinstated for a while, though probably in weakened form;
and the action is performed. As soon as it is over, the subject
is his waking self again.</p>

<p>We have the obverse of this post-hypnotic suggestion in
the phenomenon of <b>double consciousness</b>. A subject is
hypnotised and becomes somnambulistic; when he is waked,
he has no memory whatsoever of the events that occurred
during the hypnotic state. Later, he is hypnotised again;
and now it turns out that he remembers what took place
during the previous hypnosis. So he seems to have a
double consciousness; the normal waking consciousness,
which is sensibly continuous in his waking states, and a
secondary hypnotic consciousness, which is continuous from
one state of somnambulism to another. There is, again,
nothing mysterious in the facts; we have their parallel in
the normal shifts of personality; we have seen that a man
is a different self in the office, on the golf-links, with his
children in the nursery; and we have now only to add that
the known laws of memory are adequate to these phenomena
of double consciousness. For we do not pass in thought from
one situation to another unless the situations are connected
by some idea which is common to them both; the hard-worked
professional man, when he is on the links, <i>forgets</i>
the office; that is the reason for his play; and he forgets
the office because there is no community of ideas between his
work and his recreation. In hypnosis, too, we break sharply
with the waking life; if the two are to be connected, a bridge
must be built <i>ad hoc</i> by the operator; but when we relapse
into hypnosis we pick up again the thread of our hypnotic
memory, as naturally as the professional man picks up his
work when he seats himself at his desk after a half-holiday.</p>

<p>There are still a couple of questions, often asked by students,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
that you may care to have answered; and the first of them
usually takes the form: <i>Can a man be hypnotised against his
will?</i> To which the author’s reply always is: It depends
on what you mean by ‘against his will.’ For consider!
There is no reason at all why we may not, any one of us, be
taken off guard and surprised into the hypnotic state. We
have probably all been surprised by sleep during a lecture or
a sermon; the conditions were favourable, and we nodded.
So the conditions may be favourable for hypnosis; and if
someone is watching us, and sees that the conditions are
favourable, he may have us hypnotised before we know
where we are. The risk is not great; but the possibility is
there. Again, if a patient has fallen into the habit of taking
hypnotic treatment, and if he has thus slipped into a position
of invalidish dependence upon his physician, so that obedience
to the suggestion of hypnosis has become natural to
him, then it is entirely likely that the physician’s command
would induce the hypnotic state, even if the patient at the
time should not desire it. And what holds of physician and
patient holds of any operator and any subject in like circumstances;
the habit of obedience grows by obeying. In this
sense, then, one might be hypnotised ‘against one’s will.’
If, however, the question means what it is probably intended
to mean: Can another man come to me and, by virtue of
some inherent power, force me into hypnosis in spite of my
resistance to that suggestion? then the answer is No; no
more than a man can force you to lend him money or to
perjure yourself for him in a court of law. It is you who
must entertain his suggestion; so long as you refuse to do
that, you are immune to hypnosis at his hands.</p>

<p>The other question concerns the value of hypnosis for medical
or therapeutic purposes; <i>can hypnosis effect cures?
can it replace the anæsthetics of ordinary medical practice?</i>
It has, as a matter of fact, received fairly extended trial as an
anæsthetic; and while it has allowed many operations, minor
and major, to be carried out successfully, it is far less reliable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
than the an æsthetic drugs; mainly, no doubt, because it
cannot be administered by the physician, as drugs can, but
depends upon the attitude of the patient himself. There is
no future for hypnosis in this connection. As to its therapeutic
value, we can only say that whatever can be accomplished
by suggestion, in the normal life, can be accomplished
by the very strong suggestion of hypnosis in the disordered
life. A suggestion can initiate, modify, and arrest
movement; a sharp rebuke will start a child into activity,
or change his occupation, or stop a present misdeed and
prevent like misdeeds in the immediate future. A suggestion,
again, can make us blush; and a suggestion can make us
cry. Here, then, is the therapeutic value of hypnosis;
it may arrest or remedy habits like alcoholism, and it may act
upon derangements of circulation and secretion. Farther
than this it cannot go; and even within these limits its
utility is variable. Some children obey the first word of
command, and others must be bidden over and over again
before they do as they are told; some of us blush easily,
and some hardly ever; some are readily stirred to tears, and
some with great difficulty. So it is with the liability to
hypnotic suggestion; everyone is liable, but not everyone
to the same degree. Besides, as we saw just now, the habit
of hypnosis grows, like all habits, upon him who has formed
it; the patient may develop a craving for the hypnotic
treatment, and in this way may take on a habit of dependence,
of constant reliance upon others, which is as afflicting and
demoralising as the disorder which the treatment was meant
to cure. So that, on the whole, <i>hypnosis should not be lightly
appealed to; the decision should in every case remain in the
hands of the experienced physician</i>.</p>

<p>There is one other effect of hypnosis that we have not
spoken of in detail, and that is of great psychological interest;
the somnambulist, we said, will <i>perceive</i> as the operator wishes
him to perceive, will take coal for sugar and ink for wine.
It has long been debated whether this statement is literally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
true. The hypnotised subject behaves <i>as if</i> he perceived the
sugar and the wine; but is there any reason to think that he
actually perceives them? Or if the suggestion is negative,
and the subject is told that a certain person has left the room,
he will behave <i>as if</i> that person were no longer present; but
does he actually fail to see him? May not the suggestion
bear directly upon the subject’s conduct, and leave his perceptions
unchanged? The facts point in both directions.
Many of the apparent changes of perception are, in all probability,
nothing more than changes of behaviour towards the
perceptual stimuli; but there is, all the same, no impossibility
in a change of perception itself. We have already
noted the negative effects of abstraction (p. 281); and recent
experiments with normal subjects seem to show conclusively
that a suggestion, a form of words that carries the force of a
command, may set up the mental process, or the change of
mental processes, normally correlated with presence or change
of external stimulus. A red, seen under the suggestion of
blue, will not only be reported <i>as</i> bluish, but will actually
<i>look</i> bluish; and a thermally indifferent impression will not
only be reported <i>as</i> warm or cold, but will actually be <i>felt</i>
warm or cold. If such things happen in the normal waking
life, they may assuredly happen in the narrowed and intensive
suggestibility of the hypnotic state.</p>

methods of observation and careful deductive reasoning which
it shows. An elaborate, painstaking system of experiments was carried
on with over 400 mice, with the object of determining muscular coördination,
structural peculiarities, strength of the special sense organs,
habit formation, educability, and strength of memory of these little
animals. Some experiments were also undertaken along the line of
inherited peculiarities.... The work is really only a preliminary

experimental material that has been accumulated from the researches
of physiologists and psychologists is already great, but is also for the
most part inaccessible to the ordinary student, being widely scattered

which the average college library does not contain. Hence the usefulness

treatment of the various inductive methods has been

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
